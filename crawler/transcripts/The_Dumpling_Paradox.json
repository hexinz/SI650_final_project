        "Then it is no longer a dumpling. Once you cut it open, it is at best a very small open-faced sandwich.",
        "Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?",
        "I come from Sacramento.",
        "Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.",
        "No substitutions.",
        "This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.",
        "Okay, no reductions.",
        "Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.",
        "That works.",
        "No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.",
        "No eliminations.",
        "If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.",
        "And divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.",
        "Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend. If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.",
        "Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.",
        "We don't order egg rolls.",
        "Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.",
        "Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.",
        "Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.",
        "No.",
        "Uurgh.",
        "You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.",
        "I'll know.",
        "How about soup?",
        "Yeah, we can always divide soup.",
        "What about the won-tons?",
        "It's Halo night.",
        "Yeah. Okay. So?",
        "Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,",
        "She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.",
        "Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?",
        "Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.",
        "Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.",
        "You can't go out, it's Halo night.",
        "Well, for Penny it's dancing night.",
        "You go dancing every Wednesday?",
        "No.",
        "Then it's not dancing night.",
        "Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?",
        "Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.",
        "Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.",
        "Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.",
        "Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.",
        "Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.",
        "Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.",
        "Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.",
        "So?",
        "It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.",
        "Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.",
        "Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.",
        "No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.",
        "What's happening to us? We\u2019re falling apart.",
        "Who are you calling?",
        "The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.",
        "Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.",
        "No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.",
        "You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms, and human contact.",
        "My point.",
        "Shut up, Howard!",
        "What are you guys doing here?",
        "It's Halo night.",
        "So, Halo night, huh?",
        "I thought she was the whore of Omaha?",
        "Shhh!",
        "Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.",
        "I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.",
        "Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.",
        "I can't see him!",
        "That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.",
        "Well then start throwing grenades.",
        "I'm all out!",
        "That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.",
        "We said no tanks.",
        "There are no rules in hell!",
        "Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!",
        "There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.",
        "All I\u2019ve got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.",
        "And now you're out of life! Why did you hit pause?",
        "I thought I heard something.",
        "What?",
        "No, never mind, sorry. Go!"
