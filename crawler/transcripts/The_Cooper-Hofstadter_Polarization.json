        "No, no, no, you don't get it, um, Howard, enable public access.",
        "Boy, that's brilliant, but I'll see you.",
        "No.",
        "Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off.",
        "Huh, well that's handy. Um, here's a question, why?",
        "They found the remote controlled cars.",
        "Well, wait, wait, what's on top of them.",
        "Wireless webcams, wave hello.",
        "The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv.",
        "You may want to put on slacks.",
        "Who's running the red Corvette?",
        "That would be me.",
        "You know, in the future, when we\u2019re disembodied brains in jars, we\u2019re going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted.",
        "I don't want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped.",
        "I'm with you. I just have to make sure if I'm a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish. I promised my mother.",
        "I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that's something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers.",
        "Not to mention you'd have to power down on Saturdays.",
        "Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?",
        "Well, there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam's Razor would suggest that someone threw it out.",
        "It's from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates.",
        "I know. I read it before I threw it out.",
        "Okay... if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.",
        "Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgmental strangers, who wouldn't recognize true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be.",
        "I don't know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary.",
        "Forget the parties.",
        "Forget the parties? What a nerd.",
        "Are there any other honors I\u2019ve gotten that I don't know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?",
        "Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets.",
        "Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was \u201cyo mamma.\u201d",
        "I\u2019ve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma's research methodology is so flawed....",
        "Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.",
        "No we don't. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional.",
        "Okay, let me put it this way, I'm doing it.",
        "You can't. I'm the lead author.",
        "Oh, come on. The only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.",
        "I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You're welcome.",
        "Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.",
        "It doesn't need proving.",
        "So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?",
        "They're not supposed to, but they should.",
        "Alright, I don't care what you say, I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings.",
        "And I forbid it.",
        "You forbid it?",
        "If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.",
        "Oh, you admit that it's our work.",
        "No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome.",
        "Ah!",
        "Oh no he dit\u2019nt!",
        "So, how's it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other?",
        "Oh, hey, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits!",
        "They don't, that's why I saved this one.",
        "Okay, well, let's just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.",
        "Is this all stuff you want me to try on?",
        "No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.",
        "Oh.",
        "Seriously, don't even give it to charity, you won't be helping anyone. What's this.",
        "Oh, that's the bottled city of Kandor.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman.",
        "Oh, nice.",
        "It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.",
        "Here, why don't you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match.",
        "Great, be right back.",
        "Well, where you going, just put them on.",
        "Here?",
        "Oh, are you shy?",
        "No, I'm not shy.",
        "Don't worry, I won't look.",
        "I know you won't look, why would you look, there's nothing to see, well, not nothing....",
        "Sweetie, put the pants on.",
        "Putting them on.",
        "So, you know, isn't there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.",
        "No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesize facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy.",
        "What is this?",
        "Oh, why didn't you wear it at Halloween?",
        "Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.",
        "Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.",
        "Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.",
        "If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your... your only tie?",
        "Ah. Technically yes, but, if you'll notice, it's reversible. So it works as two.",
        "Oh, sweetie, I don't think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?",
        "Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade.",
        "The... the eighth grade?",
        "My last growth spurt.",
        "Okay, well, I guess we\u2019re back to the corduroy suit.",
        "Great.",
        "Hey Sheldon!",
        "Get anything good?",
        "Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.",
        "Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I'm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.",
        "Oh dear God!",
        "Little misunderstanding, huh.",
        "A little misunder.... Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.",
        "Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it.",
        "Huh.",
        "Well how do you feel?",
        "I don't understand the question.",
        "Well I'm just asking if it's difficult to be fighting with your best friend.",
        "Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that. I wonder if I\u2019ve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil.",
        "Wait... what?",
        "I couldn't poop this morning.",
        "You should just talk to him, I'm sure you guys can work this out.",
        "It's certainly preferable to my plan.",
        "Which was?",
        "A powerful laxative.",
        "Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there's no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.",
        "Excuse me, little idea?",
        "Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn't really understand it but...",
        "Of course you didn't, he said little idea?",
        "Uh, well no, no, not in... not in those words.",
        "In what words then, exactly",
        "Um, gee, the exact words aren't written... it's more the spirit in which it's",
        "What did he say?",
        "You had a lucky hunch.",
        "Don't you ever speak to me again.",
        "Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.",
        "Have fun presenting my lucky hunch.",
        "Sheldon I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Then why did you say it.",
        "I don't know, I wasn't choosing my...",
        "Were you trying to impress Penny?",
        "No, no not at all. A little bit.",
        "How\u2019d that work out for you?",
        "Libido 1, truth zero.",
        "Okay, I'm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.",
        "And I'm telling you for the last time it's pandering, it's undignified and bite me.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Bye Sheldon.",
        "There you go.",
        "You're right, this side does look better.",
        "No, no, I didn't say better, I said less stained.",
        "I just checked the house, there's probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.",
        "You're kidding.",
        "Is that all?",
        "All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock.",
        "Oh, well, then good!",
        "I wasn't expecting such a crowd, I'm a little nervous.",
        "It's okay, just open with a joke, you'll be fine.",
        "Oh, sorry, I\u2019ve just, I\u2019ve heard it before.",
        "Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.",
        "It's a classic, right?",
        "I really should have brought my own car.",
        "Yeah. What the hell was that?",
        "Any other questions?",
        "I didn't skip it, it's just an anecdote. It's not science.",
        "Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton's head, was that just an anecdote?",
        "You are not Isaac Newton.",
        "No, no that's true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.",
        "You cannot possibly be that arrogant.",
        "You continue to underestimate me, my good man.",
        "Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.",
        "As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don't need validation from lesser minds. No offence.",
        "Really, so why did you come?",
        "Because I knew you'd screw this up.",
        "I didn't screw it up.",
        "Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there.",
        "I\u2019ve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn't go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.",
        "So you admit that you're an egotist?",
        "You cannot blow up my head with your mind.",
        "Then I'll settle for an aneurysm.",
        "You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.",
        "You were trying to blow up my head.",
        "So it was working.",
        "It wasn't, it was not, you are a nutcase.",
        "Is this usually how these physics things go?",
        "More often than you'd think.",
        "You could have offered me a ride home.",
        "You're lucky I didn't run you over.",
        "I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.",
        "You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.",
        "Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it.",
        "Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologize for?",
        "Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.",
        "Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on YouTube.",
        "What?",
        "Now, who would do that?",
        "Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?",
        "Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.",
        "Uh-oh, here comes \u201cthe talk.\u201d",
        "Who's doing that?",
        "Someone from Pasadena, California named... \u201cWolowizard.\u201d",
        "Awesome!"
