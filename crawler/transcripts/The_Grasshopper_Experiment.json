        "Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.",
        "It's a children's story.",
        "Oh, no it isn't.",
        "When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.",
        "I know the reason.",
        "We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?",
        "That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?",
        "Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but...",
        "Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!",
        "Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.",
        "Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?",
        "A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.",
        "Oh. Us Indian, or \u201ccome to our casino\u201d Indian?",
        "You Indian.",
        "Oh.",
        "The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.",
        "Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.",
        "I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.",
        "Really, so do I.",
        "But you're a dentist, he's nuts.",
        "Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.",
        "It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.",
        "Oh my.",
        "Back off Sheldon.",
        "What?",
        "If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.",
        "I'm not hitting on her.",
        "And I am not your lady.",
        "And you have no wrath.",
        "You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.",
        "Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.",
        "Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.",
        "Oh, screw Princess Punchali.",
        "Hey, you can't talk to me like that.",
        "But you're not Princess Punchali.",
        "Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.",
        "Sheldon, are you hungry?",
        "I could eat.",
        "Let's go.",
        "What just happened?",
        "Beats the hell out of me.",
        "I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.",
        "What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?",
        "I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him.",
        "Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.",
        "Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.",
        "Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.",
        "This is a family matter Sheldon.",
        "No, I'm Leonard.",
        "Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.",
        "Who is it? We can't see.",
        "Turn us, turn us.",
        "Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.",
        "How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?",
        "This has nothing to do with my sperm count.",
        "You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you Rajesh.",
        "Yes Mommy.",
        "Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.",
        "Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",
        "What did I do?",
        "You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.",
        "Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",
        "Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?",
        "Take it, Raj. It's more than I\u2019ve ever gotten.",
        "And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.",
        "Drunk?",
        "And boring, her words.",
        "I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.",
        "I'm not an alcoholic.",
        "Then why were you drunk?",
        "It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.",
        "Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?",
        "Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.",
        "Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.",
        "But Papa, please....",
        "Now, Rajesh.",
        "Now listen to me....",
        "Please wait until I get into the hall.",
        "Okay, well, good night.",
        "Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?",
        "We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home.",
        "So you're not going to see her again?",
        "I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.",
        "I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?",
        "Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba libres that turned out to be kind of ... slutty.",
        "You didn't?",
        "Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
