        "Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet.",

        "We can't ask Leslie Winkle.",
        "Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?",
        "Yes.",

        "Yeah. Sack up, dude.",
        "Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.",
        "Hi guys.",

        "Hit that thang.",
        "Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we\u2019ve seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.",
        "There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.",
        "Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.",
        "That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.",
        "Proceed.",
