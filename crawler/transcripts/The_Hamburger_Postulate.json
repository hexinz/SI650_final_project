        "Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.",
        "If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.",
        "Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?",
        "He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.",
        "Thank you Sheldon.",

        "Oh dear.",

        "She didn't take my order.",
        "How can she take your order when you're too neurotic to talk to her.",
        "Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip.",
        "What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?",
        "Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.",
        "If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.",
        "You're a lucky man, Leonard.",
        "How so?",
        "You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.",
        "Well, what do you think.",

        "Thanks.",
        "See you next week.",
        "That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me.",
        "You're welcome. If you're up for it we could practise that middle section again.",
        "Uh, sure, why not.",
        "Just so we\u2019re clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I'm sexually available.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, I'm good to go.",
        "I thought you weren't interested in me.",
        "That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs.",
        "You mean my cello?",
        "No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I'm seducing you.",
        "No kidding?",
        "What can I say, I'm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?",
        "Gee, uh...",
        "Is it the waitress?",
        "Penny? What about her?",
        "Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you're a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.",
        "Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there's no point in bringing it up.",
        "You and the waitress then?",
        "No. No, there's nothing going on between Penny and me.",
        "So, you're open to a sexual relationship?",
        "Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am.",
        "Good.",
        "Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?",
        "Why don't we finish the section first.",
        "Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific.",
        "I'm good, I'm good to go.",
        "I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols \u2013 it's a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.",
        "Okay, sweetie, I know you think you're explaining yourself, but you're really not.",
        "Just come with me.",
        "Well?",
        "Well what?",
        "What does it mean?",
        "Oh, come on, you went to college.",
        "Yes, but I was eleven.",
        "Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn't want to be disturbed because they're, you know, getting busy.",
        "So you're saying Leonard has a girl in there.",
        "Well, either that or he's lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams.",
        "We really shouldn't be standing here.",
        "Oh, come on, you know, Leonard's had girls over before, right?",
        "Oh, yes, but there's usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse.",
        "Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?",
        "I didn't have to, the dates just happened to coincide.",
        "So, do you know who's in there?",
        "Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.",
        "No, no, wait, hold on.",
        "What's the matter?",
        "I don't know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage?",
        "Gee, Sheldon, you're asking the wrong girl. I'm usually on the other side of the tie.",
        "Hi, Leonard. It's me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You're welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley.",
        "My equations, someone's tampered with my equations.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Of course I'm sure. Look at the beta function of quantum chromodynamics, the sign's been changed.",
        "Oh yeah. But doesn't that fix the problem you've been having?",
        "Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you.... hey look, that fixes the problem I\u2019ve been having.",
        "You did this?",
        "Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?",
        "Cool?",
        "Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night.",
        "Thank you, I'll see you at work.",
        "Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!",
        "What?",
        "Who told you you could touch my board?",
        "No-one.",
        "I don't come into your house and touch your board.",
        "There are no incorrect equations on my board.",
        "Oh, that is so... so...",
        "Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate.",
        "Oh, hey Leonard.",
        "Oh, hi.",
        "So, how's it going?",
        "Pretty good.",
        "Just pretty good, I'd think you were doing very good.",
        "Pretty, very, there's really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?",
        "Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night.",
        "Sheldon!",
        "I'm coming.",
        "So, is it serious, do you like her?",
        "Wuh, I don't.... th-th-th-that's really two different questions, uh, I'm not.... Sheldon, we have to go!",
        "Boy, you're wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse.",
        "Alright, well, I'll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard.",
        "Thank you. What did she mean, she's happy for me? Is she happy because I'm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I'm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.",
        "Do you realize I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?",
        "You know what, I'm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she's attractive, we like each other, she's extremely intelligent.",
        "She's not that intelligent.",
        "She fixed your equation.",
        "She got lucky.",
        "You don't believe in luck.",
        "I don't have to believe in it for her to be lucky.",
        "Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I'm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy.",
        "Leonard?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I still don't care.",
        "Hey, Lesley.",
        "Careful\u00a0 Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero.",
        "Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.",
        "Because I\u2019ve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn't find a knife.",
        "Uh, what are you doing?",
        "Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?",
        "Okay, uh, what exactly do you think's going on between us?",
        "I'm not sure, but I think I'm about to discover how the banana felt.",
        "Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat's brain, give him an orgasm button, he'll push that thing until he starves to death.",
        "Who wouldn't?",
        "Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can't stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That's where you come in.",
        "Yeah, well, I'm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?",
        "Well, I don't know about your sex drive, but I'm probably good till New Years.",
        "Oh. Okay. Thank you.",
        "Thank you!",
        "You want to make plans for New Years.",
        "Woah, Leonard, please, you're smothering me.",
        "Hey, look, it's Doctor Stud!",
        "Doctor what?",
        "The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music.",
        "Wha... how did it get on the internet?",
        "I put it there.",
        "Well, how did you know about it?",
        "A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast.",
        "Well, that part's true!",
        "You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.",
        "No kidding.",
        "I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.",
        "Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.",
        "Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.",
        "So, how's everything.",
        "Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.",
        "Really, oh yay!",
        "Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?",
        "Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?",
        "Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.",
        "Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?",
        "You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.",
        "Are you even listening to me?",
        "Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
