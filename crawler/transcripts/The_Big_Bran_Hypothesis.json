        "Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.",
        "He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake\u2013scented Goddess!",
        "So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?",
        "Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.",
        "Yeah, no problem.",
        "Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.",
        "Penny, wait.",
        "Yeah?",
        "Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?",
        "A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?",
        "You're kidding, right?",
        "Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?",
        "You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.",
        "Yes, I know, men can't fly.",
        "Oh no, let's assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces.",
        "Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates.",
        "In what space, sir, in what space? She's two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he'd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.",
        "Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman's flight is a feat of strength.",
        "Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow Sun.",
        "Yeah, and you don't have a problem with that, how does he fly at night?",
        "Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.",
        "I'm just going to go wash up.",
        "I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.",
        "Also, the pretty girl left.",
        "I hardly think so.",
        "Why not?",
        "Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.",
        "Archimedes would be so proud.",
        "Do you have any ideas?",
        "Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.",
        "Exactly half.",
        "What's your formula for the corner.",
        "What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.",
        "Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.",
        "You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?",
        "Men do things for women without expecting sex.",
        "Yeah, those are men who just had sex.",
        "I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.",
        "No we\u2019re not, no we\u2019re not, no we\u2019re not!",
        "Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!",
        "You okay?",
        "So Penny's a little messy.",
        "A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.",
        "Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?",
        "No.",
        "Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.",
        "Excuse me, but I think we\u2019ve both found that helpful at times.",
        "Come on, we should go.",
        "Hang on.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Straightening up.",
        "Sheldon, this is not your home.",
        "This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.",
        "When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.",
        "Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.",
        "What were you doing in his closet?",
        "I helped him run some cable for a webcam.",
        "Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.",
        "Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?",
        "No.",
        "No?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "Well, we'll get out of your hair.",
        "Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.",
        "What's he talking about?",
        "It's a joke.",
        "I don't get it.",
        "Yeah, he didn't tell it right.",
        "Sheldon?",
        "Sheldon? Hello?",
        "Sheldon!",
        "Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.",
        "Are you insane? You can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.",
        "I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was... this.",
        "Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we\u2019re here?",
        "I just gave you a reasonable explanation.",
        "No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.",
        "Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.",
        "Sheldon, we have to get out of here.",
        "You might want to speak in a lower register.",
        "What?",
        "Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.",
        "I am not leaving until I'm done.",
        "If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.",
        "Oh, what the hell.",
        "Morning.",
        "Morning.",
        "I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.",
        "I'm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour's apartment and clean.",
        "Sarcasm?",
        "You think?",
        "Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny's quality of life.",
        "You know what, you've convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.",
        "You don't think that crosses a line?",
        "Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.",
        "You have a sarcasm sign?",
        "No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.",
        "Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.",
        "Penny's up.",
        "How did she know it was us?",
        "I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.",
        "God, this is going to be bad.",
        "Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.",
        "Yes, but, only to clean.",
        "Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per se.",
        "Give me back my key.",
        "I'm very, very sorry.",
        "Do you understand how creepy this is.",
        "Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.",
        "In my apartment, while I was sleeping.",
        "And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.",
        "And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?",
        "God!",
        "Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.",
        "Stay away from me.",
        "Sure, that's another way to go.",
        "That wasn't sarcasm?",
        "No.",
        "You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?",
        "It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.",
        "I mean, just because most of the men I\u2019ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?",
        "It's fine. You win.",
        "What's his problem?",
        "His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.",
        "Been there.",
        "Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?",
        "Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.",
        "What did she say? Is she still mad at me?",
        "Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and... then she hugged me.",
        "Intoxicating, isn't it?",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh.",
        "What's going on?",
        "Leonard.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Six two inch dowels.",
        "Check.",
        "One package, Phillips head screws.",
        "Check.",
        "You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.",
        "No, please, we insist, it\u2019s the least we can do considering.",
        "Considering what? How great this place looks?",
        "What?",
        "These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.",
        "Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.",
        "It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.",
        "We could put her stereo back there.",
        "And control it how?",
        "Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.",
        "Hey guys, I got this.",
        "Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?",
        "Also inefficient, and might be loud.",
        "How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...",
        "Guys, this is actually really simple.",
        "Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.",
        "Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?",
        "And if water is involved we\u2019re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.",
        "Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminum.",
        "Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.",
        "Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminum, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.",
        "Meet back here in an hour?",
        "Done.",
        "Okay, this place does look pretty good."
