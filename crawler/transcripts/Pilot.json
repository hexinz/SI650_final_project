In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point.",

        "That is an antisocial implication.",
        "I said I'm sorry.",
        "So, Klingon boggle?",
        "Yeah, it's like regular boggle, but in Klingon. That's probably enough about us, tell us about you.",
        "Um, me, okay, I'm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.",
        "Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun's apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.",
        "Participate in the what?",
        "I think what Sheldon's trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been our first guess.",
        "Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I'm a water sign. Okay, let's see, what else, oh, I'm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak.",
        "That's interesting. Leonard can't process corn.",
        "Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?",
        "Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.",
        "You're lactose intolerant.",
        "I don't eat it, I just think it's a good idea.",
        "Oh, anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay. It's about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",
        "So it's based on your life?",
        "No, I'm from Omaha.",
        "Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.",
        "I know, right? Okay, let's see, what else? Um, that's about it. That's the story of Penny.",
        "Well it sounds wonderful.",
        "It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk.",
        "Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that's like as long as High School.",
        "It took you four years to get through High School?",
        "Don't.",
        "I just, I can't believe I trusted him.",
        "Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.",
        "You? No, you'll only make it worse.",
        "You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?",
        "Yes.",
        "No, it's not crazy it's, uh, uh, it's a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn't make it worse.",
        "Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm such a mess, and on top of everything else I'm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn't even work.",
        "Our shower works.",
        "Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?",
        "Yes.",
        "No.",
        "No?",
        "No.",
        "No.",
        "It's right down the hall.",
        "Thanks. You guys are really sweet.",
        "Well this is an interesting development.",
        "How so?",
        "It has been some time since we\u2019ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.",
        "That's not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer's had that episode.",
        "Point taken. It has been some time since we\u2019ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn't want to rip our eyes out.",
        "The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.",
        "So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "That woman in there's not going to have sex with you.",
        "Well I'm not trying to have sex with her.",
        "Oh, good. Then you won't be disappointed.",
        "What makes you think she wouldn't have sex with me, I'm a male and she's a female?",
        "Yes, but not of the same species.",
        "I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.",
        "Oh, of course.",
        "That's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn't participate. However briefly.",
        "Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?",
        "Wait till you see this.",
        "It's fantastic. Unbelievable.",
        "See what?",
        "It's a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.",
        "This is not a good time.",
        "It's before he became a creepy computer voice",
        "That's great, you guys have to go.",
        "Why?",
        "It's just not a good time.",
        "Leonard has a lady over.",
        "Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?",
        "No. And she's not a lady, she's just a new neighbor.",
        "Hang on, there really is a lady here?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And you want us out because you're anticipating coitus?",
        "I'm not anticipating coitus.",
        "So she's available for coitus?",
        "Can we please stop saying coitus?",
        "Technically that would be coitus interruptus.",
        "Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower? Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!",
        "Enchante, Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it's currently orbiting Jupiter's largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.",
        "Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.",
        "Come on, I'll show you the trick with the shower.",
        "Bonne douche.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "It's French for good shower. It's a sentiment I can express in six languages.",
        "Save it for your blog, Howard.",
        "See-ka-tong-guay-jow.",
        "Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I'm sorry.",
        "Okay. Thanks.",
        "You're welcome, oh, you're going to step right, okay, I'll....",
        "Hey, Leonard?",
        "The hair products are Sheldon's.",
        "Um, okay. Can I ask you a favor?",
        "A favor? Sure, you can ask me a favor, I would do you a favor for you.",
        "It's okay if you say no.",
        "Oh, I'll probably say yes.",
        "It's just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you've just met.",
        "Wow.",
        "I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.",
        "Must we?",
        "Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",
        "She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.",
        "Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",
        "Which is?",
        "You think with your penis.",
        "That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.",
        "Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.",
        "Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",
        "No, I don't. And neither do you.",
        "Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",
        "You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.",
        "To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.",
        "So we get to have a scene with him?",
        "No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.",
        "Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.",
        "Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?",
        "Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.",
        "Really, why?",
        "He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",
        "Hello.",
        "What did I just.... Uh, we\u2019re here to pick up Penny's TV.",
        "Get lost.",
        "Okay, thanks for your time.",
        "We\u2019re not going to give up just like that.",
        "Leonard, the TV is in the building, we\u2019ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",
        "Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.",
        "My apologies. What's your plan.",
        "It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.",
        "Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",
        "What do you think their combined IQ is?",
        "Just grab the door.",
        "Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",
        "From the intercom.",
        "How the hell did you get in the building?",
        "Oh. We\u2019re scientists.",
        "Tell him about our IQ.",
        "Leonard.",
        "What?",
        "My mom bought me those pants.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "You're going to have to call her.",
        "Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.",
        "It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.",
        "And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.",
        "Well you got me out of my pants.",
        "Anyway, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I\u2019ve got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.",
        "Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.",
        "Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.",
        "And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.",
        "This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.",
        "Wow, cool tiger.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.",
        "Uh, sounds interesting.",
        "So you'll think about it?",
        "Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.",
        "Smooth.",
        "We\u2019re home.",
        "Oh, my God, what happened?",
        "Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.",
        "I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.",
        "No, it was a valid hypothesis.",
        "That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?",
        "Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?",
        "Really? Great.",
        "Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?",
        "Our babies will be smart and beautiful.",
        "Not to mention imaginary.",
        "Is Thai food okay with you Penny?",
        "Sure.",
        "We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",
        "So?",
        "They're both curry based cuisines.",
        "So?",
        "They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we\u2019re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.",
        "Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.",
        "That sounds like fun.",
        "Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.",
        "I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy."
