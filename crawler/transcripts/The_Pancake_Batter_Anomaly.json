        "It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels.",
        "Hey!",
        "Did you get my mail.",
        "Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?",
        "From the data at hand you really can't draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here.",
        "Boy, it's good to be back.",
        "How was your family?",
        "Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.",
        "Sick?",
        "Here we go.",

        "I don't need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?",

        "Sheldon, relax, she doesn't have any symptoms, I'm sure she's not contagious.",
        "Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose.",
        "Penny, you'll have to excuse Sheldon, he's a bit of a germophobe.",
        "Oh, it's okay, I understand.",

        "I don't think so.",
        "Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat.",
        "Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.",
        "We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.",
        "Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?",
        "When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance.",
        "I'm going back to bed.",
        "What for?",
        "I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.",

        "Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology.",
        "Leonard, where are you?",

        "Yes.",
        "On Sunday?",
        "Yes.",
        "Why?",
        "They asked me to come in.",
        "Well, I didn't hear the phone ring.",
        "They texted me.",
        "Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate.",
        "No kidding?",
        "No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green.",
        "Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids.",
        "What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?",
        "Drink whatever you want.",
        "I want soup.",
        "Then make soup.",
        "We don't have soup.",
        "Is that a dog?",
        "Yes,",
        "In the lab?",
        "Yes, they're training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.",
        "I know it's the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.",
        "Well who's calling at this ungodly hour?",
        "I don't know.",
        "Well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour.",

        "Dear Lord, not Milky Green!",

        "Who's on the phone.",
        "It's Leonard.",
        "Why is he calling.",
        "Sheldon's sick.",
        "Were you playing with him?",
        "For God's sake, Ma, I'm twenty six years old.",
        "Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.",
        "Chocolate milk and eggoes please!",
        "Howard, listen to me.",
        "Hang on, call waiting.",
        "Hello.",
        "Howard, I'm sick.",
        "I need soup.",
        "I tried to stop you.",
        "It's my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of \u201906.",
        "You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours.",
        "Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?",
        "I just had the carpets steamed.",
        "That's a negatory. But there's a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.",
        "Five movies, two hours apiece. It's a start.",
        "Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen.",
        "No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?",
        "I'm sick, thank you very much.",
        "How could you have gotten it from me, I'm not sick.",
        "You're a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You're doomed!",
        "Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.",
        "I want soup.",
        "Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don't you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?",
        "You can have soup delivered.",
        "I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.",
        "Okay, what kind of soup do you want.",
        "We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.",
        "Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?",
        "No.",
        "Look at this, everyone went chimp.",
        "Oh, hi Penny!",
        "Hey, where are you?",
        "I'm... uh... at work.",
        "You sound funny.",
        "I'm... uh... in a... I'm in a radiation suit. What's up?",
        "Yeah, well I'm at work too, and you'll never guess who's here infecting my entire station.",
        "He won't leave, he says he's afraid he'll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.",
        "Can you please come get him?",
        "Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape.",
        "Thanks for bringing me home.",
        "Oh, it's okay, I didn't really need to work today, it's not like I have rent or car payments or anything.",
        "Good. Good.",
        "Okay, well, you feel better.",
        "Wait, where are you going?",
        "Um, home, to write some bad checks.",
        "You're going to leave me?",
        "Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven't you ever been sick before?",
        "Well, of course, but, not by myself.",
        "Really, never?",
        "Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.",
        "Studying abroad?",
        "No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I'm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia.",
        "And there was no-one there to take care of you?",
        "No. No, my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.",
        "Again?",
        "It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said \u201cM\u00f6chtest Du eine Darmsp\u00fclung?\u201d",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Based on what happened next, I assume it means \u201cwould you like an enema?\u201d",
        "Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?",
        "Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.",
        "Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.",
        "Agreed.",
        "Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.",
        "Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?",
        "Oh great.",
        "Sorry, don\u2019t you have a spare.",
        "Yeah, at home.",
        "Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.",
        "Unless Sheldon\u2019s there, in which case you\u2019ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.",
        "How about Lasic?",
        "You want me to get eye surgery?",
        "Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?",
        "Well?",
        "I\u2019m thinking!",
        "Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I\u2019ll see you later.",
        "Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.",
        "Oh, Sheldon, can\u2019t you do that yourself?",
        "Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.",
        "But Sheldon\u2026.",
        "Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",
        "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.",
        "No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Can you sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d.",
        "What?",
        "My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.",
        "I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.",
        "I'll teach you. \u201cSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.\u201d Now you.",
        "Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.",
        "What do you see, what do you see.",
        "The living room appears to be empty.",
        "Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.",
        "I'm not going in there.",
        "Raj?",
        "No way, Jose.",
        "Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.",
        "It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes.",
        "Fine.",
        "One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.",
        "Won't my footsteps set it off?",
        "No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.",
        "Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?",
        "Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.",
        "What?",
        "It means go straight.",
        "Then just say go straight.",
        "You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.",
        "The... the picture's breaking up.",
        "It wasn't on?",
        "No.",
        "Then why did I have to crawl?",
        "Oh, I guess you didn't.",
        "Okay, it's on.",
        "Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.",
        "I know.",
        "You rat bastard.",
        "Hi!",
        "You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.",
        "Well, I had to, you see what he's like.",
        "Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!",
        "No!",
        "W-wait!",
        "Leonard, I'm hungry!",
        "I want grilled cheese.",
        "Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?",
        "I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.",
        "I'm very congested.",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.",
        "If I stand, I'll vomit.",
        "Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
