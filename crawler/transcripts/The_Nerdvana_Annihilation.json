        "Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.",
        "Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.",

        "Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I\u2019ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!",
        "Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.",
        "You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, \u201cyou wanna come up and see my time machine, it\u2019s at my friends house,\u201d how lame is that?",
        "He's got a point.",
        "Alright, I think we\u2019re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.",
        "Seconded.",
        "I was going to put down a towel.",
        "I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.",
        "That sounds fair.",
        "Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?",
        "Twice a month.",
        "Then no.",
        "Okay, every other month.",
        "No.",

        "Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too.",
        "So, when it's your turn you can.",
        "But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up.",
        "Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.",
        "And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, \u201chey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?\u201d",
        "Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock.",
        "Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.",
        "Ooh, how far into the future?",
        "If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.",
        "My turn.",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.",
        "That doesn't sound too bad.",
        "It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they\u2019d given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I\u2019ve lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...",
        "Time machine.",
        "The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?",
        "No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...",
        "Again, time machine.",
        "Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.",
        "It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.",
        "My turn!",
        "Leonard, it's two in the morning.",
        "So?",
        "So it's my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?",
        "Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.",
        "You can't. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake.",
        "Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?",
        "Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious.",
        "What if I knocked you unconscious right now?",
        "It won't change the past.",
        "But it would make the present so much nicer.",
        "Are you upset about something?",
        "What was your first clue?",
        "Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability...",
        "Yes I'm upset.",
        "Oh! I don't usually pick up on those things. Good for me.",
        "Yeah, good for you.",
        "Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what's bothering you?",
        "I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Wow, I'm on fire tonight.",
        "Uh, here's the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines.",
        "I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.",
        "Thanks for pointing it out.",
        "In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother.",
        "Those are movies.",
        "Well of course they're movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That's absurd.",
        "Come on, guys, push.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine.",
        "Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....",
        "But, what about your time machine.",
        "Oh, I'm scared.",
        "Don't worry baby, I\u2019ve got you.",
        "It's still my turn.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I'm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell.",
        "Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen.",
        "It's not about money.",
        "Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travelers.",
        "Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?",
        "Why?",
        "Because I don't want it any more.",
        "Why?",
        "Just... personal reasons.",
        "My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.",
        "Look, do you want to buy me out or not?",
        "I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.",
        "Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage.",
        "I paid two hundred dollars for my share.",
        "Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.",
        "I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.",
        "Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.",
        "No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.",
        "You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.",
        "More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?",
        "Not for long.",
        "Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.",
        "Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.",
        "Too bad, I called dibs.",
        "Well you can't just call dibs.",
        "I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.",
        "Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.",
        "It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.",
        "Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?",
        "Will you forget dibs!",
        "He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.",
        "What's the number, I'll match it.",
        "I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.",
        "What's the exchange rate.",
        "None of your business. Take it or leave it.",
        "Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.",
        "Who cares, as long as you pick me.",
        "Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.",
        "Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.",
        "Sheldon, get out of my way.",
        "Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek:\u00a0 The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.",
        "Okay man, be cool, we\u2019re all friends here.",
        "You hypocrite!",
        "What?",
        "Little Miss \u201cgrown ups don\u2019t play with toys\u201d. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!",
        "Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.",
        "No, I needed to hear it.",
        "No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.",
        "I guess that makes me large breasts.",
        "Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...",
        "Excuse me. Hey, Penny!",
        "Hi Mike.",
        "Are you ready to go.",
        "Yeah, I just have to change.",
        "I'll give you a hand.",
        "Oh, stop it! Bye guys.",
        "Sheldon, are you okay?",
        "We have to get rid of the time machine.",
        "It is a little big for the living room, isn't it?",
        "Yeah, that's the problem, it's too big."
