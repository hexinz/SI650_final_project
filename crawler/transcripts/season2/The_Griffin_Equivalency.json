        "\u00a0Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.",
        "\u00a0I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.",
        "\u00a0I can't see her, center her in the frame.",
        "\u00a0Here you go, cute huh?",
        "\u00a0She's not Indian.",
        "\u00a0So, she's not Indian, the boy's just sowing some wild oats.",
        "\u00a0No, no, there's no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.",
        "\u00a0What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.",
        "\u00a0What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?",
        "\u00a0Look, Rajesh, I understand, you're in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don't want it for a steady diet.",
        "\u00a0Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you'd excuse me, I have to go throw up.",
        "\u00a0What's wrong with him?",
        "\u00a0I don't know, maybe it's the local cuisine. Okay, well, it's nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I'm going to leave so, Namaste.\u00a0(Leaves, then almost immediately returns)\u00a0And FYI, you'd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.",
        "\u00a0She's feisty. I like that.",
        "\u00a0Penny's apartment. She is in her bathrobe. A note slides under the door.",
        "\u00a0Raj, what are you doing.\u00a0(He hands her the note).\u00a0No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.",
        "\u00a0Sorry.",
        "\u00a0Oh, sweetie, it's okay.\u00a0(She hugs him. As she does, Leonard exits his apartment to see Penny, in bathrobe, hugging Raj who is apparently about to leave. As she goes back inside, Raj turns, smiles, and puts both thumbs up. Leonard turns, with an upset look, to Sheldon who is standing behind him. Sheldon gives him his exaggerated smile.)"
