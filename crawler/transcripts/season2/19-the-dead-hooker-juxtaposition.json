Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he\u2019s doing. The man says, \u201cwell, I\u2019m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\u201d The owner then says, \u201cwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don\u2019t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?\u201d And the physicist says, \u201cyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?\u201d"
