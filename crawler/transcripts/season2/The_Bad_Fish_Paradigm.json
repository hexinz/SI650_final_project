        "Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends.",
        "(runs out.)",
        "Well you can't stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment.",
        "Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder?",
        "I hate trains.",
        "Don't be ridiculous, you love trains.",
        "(Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)",
        "This could work.",
        "Raj's apartment.",
        "This is a very old building.",
        "Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory.",
        "Uh-oh.",
        "What?",
        "Don't you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?",
        "Not until now.",
        "I can't believe I didn't bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn't pack it.",
        "Well, if you're not comfortable staying here, Sheldon...",
        "I'm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo.",
        "Terrific.",
        "(Referring to Bollywood singing on television)",
        "Yes, isn't she an amazing actress.",
        "Actually, I'd say she's a poor man's Madhuri Dixit.",
        "How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.",
        "Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Obviously you're not that familiar with Indian cinema.",
        "Howard's house. The door rings.",
        "Who is it?",
        "(Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.)",
        "(Runs away.)",
        "Shouldn't you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire?",
        "Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",
        "I\u2019ve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever.",
        "Maybe you'd be happier on a park bench?",
        "I don't see any way to get a park bench in here.",
        "Do you want to switch?",
        "No, that's fine. I'm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle.",
        "Get out of bed, we\u2019re switching.",
        "Now, only if you want to.",
        "Just get in the bed!",
        "(Off)",
        "We\u2019re just talking ma.",
        "If you don't settle down right now, I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers.",
        "(To Sheldon)",
        "Meh. That poster of Halle Berry's a little unnerving.",
        "So don't look at it.",
        "She's like my fourth favorite catwoman.",
        "No kidding?",
        "Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.",
        "What about Lee Meriwether?",
        "Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.",
        "Well I'm glad that's settled.",
        "That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite catwoman. There's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether...",
        "Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.",
        "I'm trying, I'm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.",
        "Oh for God's sake.",
        "But she's not my favorite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel....",
        "Apartment 4A. There is an urgent rapping at the door.",
        "(Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pajamas. Howard is outside.)",
        "Hey, there he is, there's my old buddy-bud-bud.",
        "What's with him?",
        "Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it. But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it.",
        "I'm ba-ack!",
        "I still don't know why you left.",
        "I can't tell you.",
        "Why not.",
        "I promised Penny.",
        "You promised Penny what?",
        "That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!",
        "What secret. Tell me the secret.",
        "Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell Dad.",
        "Not that secret, the other secret.",
        "I'm Batman. Shhhhh!",
        "Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.",
        "Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard.",
        "I promise.",
        "Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.",
        "So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?",
        "I drank milk that tasted funny.",
        "Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.",
        "I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows.",
        "The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny\u2019s door.",
        "(Opening door)",
        "Yeah, hi, listen, I know what's been bothering you about us, and I have the answer.",
        "What are you talking about.",
        "First I want to say that it's not Sheldon's fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn't drugged him he would have taken it to his grave.",
        "He told you?",
        "(Hands her a brochure.)",
        "Pasadena city college?",
        "A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here's playing hacky sack, and this girl's going to be a paralegal.",
        "Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can't date a girl without a fancy college degree.",
        "Well, it's really not that fancy, it's just a city college.",
        "Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you?",
        "That doesn't matter to me at all.",
        "So, it's fine with you if I'm not smart.",
        "(She slams the door in his face.)"
