Sorry, I can\u2019t see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school\u2019s great if you look like this, but I didn\u2019t even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you\u2019re the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you\u2019re graduating and you still haven\u2019t had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don\u2019t have any friends. And guess what?
