        "You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant.",
        "No kidding.",
        "I won't go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger.",
        "Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted.",
        "Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can't grow soup.",
        "So, how's everything.",
        "Terrific, you'll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.",
        "Really, oh yay!",
        "Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table?",
        "Um, I don't know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley?",
        "Oh, to be honest, I don't think it's going to work out.",
        "(Walks away smiling)",
        "Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention?",
        "You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio.",
        "Are you even listening to me?",
        "Of course I'm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.",
        "(Sheldon nods)"
