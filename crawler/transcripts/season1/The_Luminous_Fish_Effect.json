        "(Entering)",
        "Morning.",
        "Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?",
        "It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.",
        "But intelligently designed by a creator, right?",
        "What do you want, mom?",
        "You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?",
        "Yeah.",
        "(Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed)",
        "What for?",
        "Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologize to your boss, and get your job back.",
        "No.",
        "I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words \u201cif it please your highness?\u201d",
        "I'm not going to apologize, I didn't say anything that wasn't true.",
        "Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.",
        "Why not?",
        "(Exits)",
        "Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.",
        "The kitchen",
        "Problem solved.",
        "Really? That's impressive.",
        "Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup.",
        "Dr. Gablehouser\u2019s office",
        "Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?",
        "Well, actually....",
        "Sheldon, he's just doodling, get in here.",
        "Dr Gablehouser.",
        "Dr Cooper.",
        "Let's go, baby, we\u2019re losing daylight.",
        "Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out.",
        "(To Mary Cooper)",
        "Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.",
        "Now that's impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager.",
        "Oh, aren't you sweet, his father's dead.",
        "Recently?",
        "Long enough.",
        "(Indicating chair)",
        "(Leaving)",
        "Hey, how did it go?",
        "I got my job back.",
        "Really? What happened?",
        "I'm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me.",
        "That narrows it down.",
        "Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Mary Cooper is tucking him in.",
        "I'm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.",
        "Thanks, mom. Mom?",
        "Mmm-hmm?",
        "Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?",
        "We'll see. Sleep tight."
