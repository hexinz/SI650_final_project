        "Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.",
        "Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?",
        "He really needs to dial it down.",
        "So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?",
        "Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.",
        "You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?",
        "Oh, I don't think she's a whore.",
        "No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at... Where's Howard?",
        "(Voice off)",
        "Oh good grief.",
        "Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny\u2019s apartment door.",
        "Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.",
        "And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8:13, and we're still not\u00a0playing Halo.",
        "Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.",
        "One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!",
        "Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.",
        "Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.",
        "Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.",
        "Great idea.",
        "Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.",
        "Why?",
        "Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.",
        "Oh, what, what, what?",
        "This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.",
        "(Picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)",
        "Mine.",
        "Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.",
        "It's the only way we can play teams.",
        "(another explosion)",
        "Ha-ha, there goes your head again.",
        "(explosion)",
        "Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.",
        "Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!",
        "Penny, you are on fire.",
        "Yeah, so is Sheldon.",
        "Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.",
        "Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.",
        "What?",
        "(Explosion.)",
        "You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.",
        "Gosh, he's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?",
        "Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner.",
        "Well, it's been fun.",
        "You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.",
        "Or we could just have a life.",
        "I guess for you that's an option.",
        "Good night, Leonard.",
        "Good night.",
        "(leaves.)",
        "What do you suppose she meant by that?",
        "She's an enigma, Raj.",
        "And another thing, there's a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab...",
        "She's gone, Sheldon.",
        "Well she could have said goodbye.",
        "(Entering again)",
        "It's called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it.",
        "What's wrong?",
        "Um, well, Howard and Christy are... kind of... hooking up in my bedroom.",
        "Are you sure?",
        "Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they're either having sex or Howard's caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?",
        "No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics.",
        "Uh, the couch is good.",
        "Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment.",
        "Let me guess, you have a problem with this?",
        "Where do I begin?",
        "It's up to you, crazy person's choice.",
        "Well first, we don't have house guests. Frankly, if I could afford the rent, I'd ask you to leave.",
        "Your friendship means a lot to me as well. What else?",
        "Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two-man, two day kit.",
        "So?",
        "So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon.",
        "I'm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?",
        "No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does.",
        "Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.",
        "Hu... what?",
        "reductio-ad-absurdum",
        "I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.",
        "Okay, well since I'm obviously being ignored here, let's go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20. Plan your oblutions and bodily functions accordingly.",
        "How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?",
        "I suggest no liquids after 11pm.",
        "Here you go.",
        "(Arranges pillows on left of couch.)",
        "Hmmph, wrong.",
        "I'm listening.",
        "Your head goes on the other end.",
        "Why?",
        "It's culturally universal. A bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.",
        "I'll risk it.",
        "Hm!",
        "Anything else I should know?",
        "Yes. If you use my toothbrush, I'll jump out that window. Please don't come to my funeral. Have a good night.",
        "Sorry about that.",
        "That's okay.",
        "FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light.",
        "Got it.",
        "Well, sleep tight.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally... Sleep tight.",
        "Penny goes to sleep. Cut to view of the kitchen, where Raj is seen eating a sandwich. He lets himself out of the apartment. Upon hearing the door close, a startled Penny tries to go back to sleep, but quickly changes her pillow to the other end of the couch.",
        "The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down by Penny's head when Leonard enters.",
        "What are you doing?",
        "Penny's still sleeping.",
        "Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal...",
        "I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?",
        "Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.",
        "Uh, what time is it?",
        "Almost 6:30.",
        "I slept all day?",
        "Oh, no, it's 6:30 in the morning.",
        "What the hell is your problem?",
        "Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.",
        "(Entering)",
        "Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?",
        "Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.",
        "That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.",
        "In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.",
        "Y-you used my loofah?",
        "we",
        "You can keep that too.",
        "Ah, well then we'll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.",
        "(Voice off)",
        "In here my lady.",
        "(Entering)",
        "(they kiss)",
        "Well there's one beloved children's book I'll never read again.",
        "Hi. Christy.",
        "Leonard.",
        "I'm Sheldon.",
        "Right, you're Howard's entourage.",
        "Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?",
        "Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.",
        "Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's... a little crowded.",
        "Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.",
        "Oh, terrific, now we\u2019re running a cute little B&B.",
        "Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christy stay with me?",
        "For one thing you live with your mother.",
        "I do not, my mother lives with me.",
        "Well then, it's all settled, Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.",
        "Sheldon you just can't dictate...",
        "No more talking, everybody go!",
        "So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?",
        "What is that, like a Mexican deli?",
        "I'm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.",
        "Oh, that's so cool. My first Jew!",
        "I imagine there aren't many kosher corn-huskers.",
        "But you're still taking me shopping, right?",
        "Anything you want.",
        "Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.",
        "When they perfect human cloning, I'm going to order twelve of those.",
        "Howard, can't you see she's using you?",
        "Who cares? Last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!",
        "Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she'll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yay! If you'll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mitzvah bonds to cash.",
        "A Chinese restaurant.",
        "I'm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.",
        "We can't order Chinese food without Wolowitz?",
        "Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Tso's chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-mein. Do you see the problem?",
        "a",
        "Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided amongst four people.",
        "So, we'll just order three entrees.",
        "Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling?",
        "We could cut it into thirds.",
        "Then it is no longer a dumpling. Once you cut it open, it is at best a very small open-faced sandwich.",
        "Hi fellas. Oh, where's your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?",
        "(Pointing at waiter)",
        "I come from Sacramento.",
        "Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.",
        "No substitutions.",
        "This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.",
        "Okay, no reductions.",
        "Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.",
        "That works.",
        "No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.",
        "No eliminations.",
        "If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.",
        "And divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.",
        "Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend. If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.",
        "Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.",
        "We don't order egg rolls.",
        "Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.",
        "Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.",
        "Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.",
        "No.",
        "Uurgh.",
        "You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.",
        "I'll know.",
        "(wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)",
        "How about soup?",
        "Yeah, we can always divide soup.",
        "What about the won-tons?",
        "Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks.",
        "(Answering)",
        "It's Halo night.",
        "Yeah. Okay. So?",
        "Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,",
        "She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.",
        "Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?",
        "Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.",
        "Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.",
        "You can't go out, it's Halo night.",
        "Well, for Penny it's dancing night.",
        "You go dancing every Wednesday?",
        "No.",
        "Then it's not dancing night.",
        "Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?",
        "Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.",
        "Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.",
        "Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.",
        "Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.",
        "Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.",
        "Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.",
        "Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.",
        "So?",
        "It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.",
        "Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.",
        "Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.",
        "No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.",
        "What's happening to us? We\u2019re falling apart.",
        "Who are you calling?",
        "The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "Outside Howard\u2019s house.",
        "Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.",
        "No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.",
        "You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms, and human contact.",
        "My point.",
        "(Voice from within)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "Shut up, Howard!",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice as Howard emerges through door)",
        "(Voice)",
        "What are you guys doing here?",
        "It's Halo night.",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "(Voice)",
        "So, Halo night, huh?",
        "I thought she was the whore of Omaha?",
        "Shhh!",
        "The apartment, Halo night.",
        "Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he's charging his plasma rifle.",
        "I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.",
        "Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.",
        "I can't see him!",
        "That's why the call it cloaking, dead man.",
        "Well then start throwing grenades.",
        "I'm all out!",
        "(Entering with three other sexy women)",
        "That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.",
        "We said no tanks.",
        "There are no rules in hell!",
        "Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack!",
        "(They leave)",
        "There's a sniper, use your rocket launcher.",
        "All I\u2019ve got is a needler, and I'm all out of ammo.",
        "And now you're out of life! Why did you hit pause?",
        "I thought I heard something.",
        "What?",
        "No, never mind, sorry. Go!"
