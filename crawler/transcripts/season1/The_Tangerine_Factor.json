        "Oh, that's nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just... want to sit down?",
        "Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don't spend much time here and so I\u2019ve never really chosen a place to sit.",
        "Well, choose.",
        "There are a number of options and, I'm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.",
        "Alright, why don't you just pick one at random, and then if you don't like it you can sit somewhere else next time.",
        "No, no, that's crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out.",
        "Okay. Um, here's the thing. So, I\u2019ve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me...",
        "A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy.",
        "Alright, yeah, I don't really know who they are...",
        "Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon...",
        "Yeah, I don't care, I don't care. The point is Leonard isn't the kind of guy I usually go out with.",
        "Leonard isn't the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees?",
        "No. What I'm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well.",
        "The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare!",
        "But on the other hand, if things don't go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he's not looking for a fling, he's the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don't know, like you would say light years.",
        "I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time.",
        "Thank you for the clarification.",
        "Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that's a unit of work, not of weight.",
        "Right, thanks.",
        "It's a common mistake.",
        "Not the first one I\u2019ve made today.",
        "Okay. I think this will be my seat.",
        "Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I'm talking about.",
        "Well, let's see. We might consider Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.",
        "Schr\u00f6dinger? Is that the woman in 2A?",
        "No. That's Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn't have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip...",
        "Sheldon!",
        "Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead.",
        "I'm sorry, I don't get the point.",
        "Well of course you don't get it, I haven't made it yet. You'd have to be psychic to get it, and there's no such thing as psychic.",
        "Sheldon, what's the point?",
        "Just like Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is.",
        "Okay, so you're saying I should go out with Leonard.",
        "No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger...",
        "Caltech cafeteria.",
        "(Pointing)",
        "(To two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats)",
        "Sheldon, I think I\u2019ve made a mistake.",
        "I can see that. Unless you're planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.",
        "No, it's about Penny.",
        "A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you'll have to narrow it down.",
        "I don't think I can go out with her tonight.",
        "Then don't.",
        "Other people would say \u201cwhy not?\u201d",
        "Other people might be interested.",
        "I'm going to talk anyway.",
        "I assumed you would.",
        "Now that I'm actually about to go out with Penny, I'm not excited, I'm nauseous.",
        "Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion.",
        "Right.",
        "You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on.",
        "Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it.",
        "Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind.",
        "You're not helping.",
        "Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?",
        "Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.",
        "Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat.",
        "Wow, that's brilliant.",
