        "Aren\u2019t you afraid I'll embarrass you?",
        "Yes. But I need a wing-man.",
        "Alright, but if we\u2019re going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analyzing wreckage.",
        "Oh, Hi!",
        "Hi.",
        "Hello.",
        "So, what are you supposed to be?",
        "Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!",
        "Uh, a choo-choo train?",
        "Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!",
        "A brain damaged choo-choo train?",
        "(Dropping onto sofa next to Raj)",
        "Neeeeeooooowwwwww!",
        "I still don't get it.",
        "I'm the Doppler Effect.",
        "Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.",
        "Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?",
        "Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.",
        "Because I'm Frodo.",
        "Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.",
        "Oh no.",
        "What?",
        "That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.",
        "What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.",
        "If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.",
        "Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.",
        "(Penny and Kurt hug)",
        "You have a back-up hypothesis.",
        "Maybe they just want to be friends.",
        "Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.",
        "Then he and I are on equal ground.",
        "Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.",
        "Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.",
        "And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.",
        "Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.",
        "True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?",
        "No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.",
        "Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",
        "Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.",
        "Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",
        "Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.",
        "What, you're a zebra, right?",
        "Yet another child left behind.",
        "And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?",
        "No, I'm a Hobbit.",
        "What's the difference?",
        "Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior.",
        "So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?",
        "Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash.",
        "Well, whatever, why don't you go hop off on a quest, I'm talking to Penny here.",
        "I think we\u2019re all talking to Penny here.",
        "I'm not. No offence.",
        "Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.",
        "Alright Kurt, be nice.",
        "Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.",
        "Kurt!",
        "Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.",
        "Are you calling me a puffy animal?",
        "Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?",
        "No, I said animalistic. Of course we\u2019re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree.",
        "If he understands that, you're in trouble.",
        "So what, I'm unevolved?",
        "You're in trouble.",
        "You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf.",
        "Okay, Kurt, please.",
        "No, Penny, it's okay, I can handle this. I'm not a dwarf, I'm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?",
        "Okay, now you're starting to make me mad.",
        "A homo-habilis discovering his opposable thumbs says what?",
        "What?",
        "I think I\u2019ve made my point.",
        "Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.",
        "Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless.",
        "There's not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.",
        "(Physically lifting Leonard from the ground)",
        "Kurt, put him down this instant.",
        "He started it.",
        "I don't care, I'm finishing it, put him down.",
        "Fine. You're one lucky little leprechaun.",
        "He's a Hobbit! I\u2019ve got your back.",
        "Leonard, are you okay.",
        "Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's good, it's a good party, thanks for having us, it's just getting a little late so....",
        "Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming.",
        "(They leave)",
        "The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.",
        "What's that?",
        "Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?",
        "No.",
        "Good. There there was really all I had.",
        "Good night Sheldon.",
        "Good night Leonard.",
        "(Knocking on door and entering)",
        "Hi Penny.",
        "Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.",
        "I'm fine.",
        "I'm so sorry about what happened.",
        "It's not your fault.",
        "Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.",
        "So why was he at your party?",
        "(bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard\u2019s shoulder.)",
        "There there.",
        "God, what is wrong with me.",
        "Nothing, you're perfect.",
        "Gah, I'm not perfect.",
        "Yes you are.",
        "(She kisses hm.)",
        "Penny?",
        "Yeah.",
        "How much have you had to drink tonight?",
        "Just.... a lot.",
        "Are you sure that you're being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?",
        "It might. Boy, you're really smart.",
        "Yeah, I'm a frickin\u2019 genius.",
        "Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?",
        "Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.",
        "I should probably go.",
        "Probably.",
        "(In doorway)",
        "(Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)",
        "The apartment, there is a knock on the door.",
        "(Opens door to Howard.)",
        "Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",
        "He's not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him.",
        "He's not the Marvel comic story, he's the original Norse God.",
        "Thank you for the clarification.",
        "I'm supposed to give him a ride home.",
        "Well I'm sure he'll be fine. He has his hammer.",
        "A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj.",
        "Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You're gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener!"
