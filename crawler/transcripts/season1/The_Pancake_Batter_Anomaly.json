        "No. No, my mom had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again.",
        "Again?",
        "It was tornado season. And it was an aluminum house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn't speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said \u201cM\u00f6chtest Du eine Darmsp\u00fclung?\u201d",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Based on what happened next, I assume it means \u201cwould you like an enema?\u201d",
        "Okay, sweetie, I'll take care of you, what do you need?",
        "Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.",
        "Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas.",
        "Agreed.",
        "The cinema.",
        "Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness.",
        "Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I'm blind here guys, can you help me find them?",
        "(Crunching sound)",
        "Oh great.",
        "Sorry, don\u2019t you have a spare.",
        "Yeah, at home.",
        "Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.",
        "Unless Sheldon\u2019s there, in which case you\u2019ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.",
        "(Dials phone)",
        "How about Lasic?",
        "You want me to get eye surgery?",
        "Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?",
        "Well?",
        "I\u2019m thinking!",
        "Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.",
        "Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I\u2019ll see you later.",
        "Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.",
        "Oh, Sheldon, can\u2019t you do that yourself?",
        "Vaporub makes my hands smell funny.",
        "But Sheldon\u2026.",
        "Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",
        "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this.",
        "No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Can you sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d.",
        "What?",
        "My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.",
        "I'm sorry, honey, I don't know it.",
        "I'll teach you. \u201cSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.\u201d Now you.",
        "(After a loud sigh)",
        "Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing.",
        "(Through gritted teeth)",
        "The living room door, a fiber-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door.",
        "What do you see, what do you see.",
        "The living room appears to be empty.",
        "Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal.",
        "I'm not going in there.",
        "Raj?",
        "No way, Jose.",
        "Well I can't do it, I can't see anything.",
        "It's all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We'll be your eyes.",
        "Fine.",
        "One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you'll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.",
        "Won't my footsteps set it off?",
        "No, you'll be on your hands and knees. Now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room.",
        "Well, how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees?",
        "Cut to Leonard entering apartment on hands and knees, carrying the sensor in his teeth.",
        "Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.",
        "What?",
        "It means go straight.",
        "Then just say go straight.",
        "You don't stay go straight when you're giving bearings, you say keep true.",
        "(Bangs head on a trunk.)",
        "(Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms)",
        "The... the picture's breaking up.",
        "(Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body)",
        "It wasn't on?",
        "No.",
        "Then why did I have to crawl?",
        "Oh, I guess you didn't.",
        "Okay, it's on.",
        "Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl.",
        "I know.",
        "(Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.)",
        "You rat bastard.",
        "(Running down stairs with Raj)",
        "Hi!",
        "You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon.",
        "Well, I had to, you see what he's like.",
        "(Off)",
        "Uh, it's okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard's home!",
        "No!",
        "(Handing him vaporub)",
        "W-wait!",
        "Leonard, I'm hungry!",
        "(Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor.\u00a0 Sheldon appears in his comforter.)",
        "I want grilled cheese.",
        "Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are on the sofa. Sheldon is wrapped in his comforter, Leonard is holding an ice-pack to his head.",
        "Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us?",
        "I don't think Penny's ever coming here again.",
        "I'm very congested.",
        "Yeah, so?",
        "Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.",
        "If I stand, I'll vomit.",
        "Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl."
