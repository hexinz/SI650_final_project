        "I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.",
        "Must we?",
        "Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",
        "She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.",
        "Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",
        "Which is?",
        "You think with your penis.",
        "That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.",
        "Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.",
        "Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",
        "No, I don't. And neither do you.",
        "Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",
        "You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.",
        "To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.",
        "So we get to have a scene with him?",
        "No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.",
        "Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.",
        "Back at the apartment.",
        "(To Raj)",
        "(Raj looks at her, looks back at his food, takes a mouthful).",
        "Uh, I'm sorry, do you speak English?",
        "Oh, he speaks English, he just can't speak to women.",
        "Really, why?",
        "He's kind of a nerd. Juice box?",
        "Outside Penny\u2019s old apartment building.",
        "(Pushes buzzer)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",
        "Hello.",
        "What did I just.... Uh, we\u2019re here to pick up Penny's TV.",
        "Get lost.",
        "Okay, thanks for your time.",
        "We\u2019re not going to give up just like that.",
        "Leonard, the TV is in the building, we\u2019ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",
        "Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.",
        "My apologies. What's your plan.",
        "(Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)",
        "It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.",
        "Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",
        "(Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)",
        "What do you think their combined IQ is?",
        "Just grab the door.",
        "Outside Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend\u2019s apartment.",
        "(Knocks.)",
        "Good thinking, I'll just be the muscle.",
        "Yeah?",
        "I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",
        "From the intercom.",
        "How the hell did you get in the building?",
        "Oh. We\u2019re scientists.",
        "Tell him about our IQ.",
        "Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.",
        "Leonard.",
        "What?",
        "My mom bought me those pants.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "You're going to have to call her.",
        "On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s building.",
        "Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.",
        "It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.",
        "And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.",
        "Well you got me out of my pants.",
        "Anyway, I\u2019ve learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I\u2019ve got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.",
        "Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.",
        "Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.",
        "And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.",
        "Inside Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment.",
        "This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.",
        "Wow, cool tiger.",
        "Yeah, I\u2019ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.",
        "Uh, sounds interesting.",
        "So you'll think about it?",
        "Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.",
        "Smooth.",
        "We\u2019re home.",
        "Oh, my God, what happened?",
        "Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.",
        "I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.",
        "No, it was a valid hypothesis.",
        "That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?",
        "Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?",
        "Really? Great.",
        "Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?",
        "Our babies will be smart and beautiful.",
        "Not to mention imaginary.",
        "All five in Leonard\u2019s car.",
        "Is Thai food okay with you Penny?",
        "Sure.",
        "We can't have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",
        "So?",
        "They're both curry based cuisines.",
        "So?",
        "They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we\u2019re going to have to spell out everything for this girl.",
        "(He just looks at her with a worried expression.)",
        "Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.",
        "That sounds like fun.",
        "Baby, baby don't get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don't get hooked on me.",
        "I don't know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, you're a veritable Mack Daddy."
