        "What if they don't come.",
        "We'll make it nice, put out a spread.",
        "Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we\u2019re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.",
        "Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.",
        "Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of... um... he's nuts.",
        "(Voice off, sings to a Mexican tune)",
        "The welcoming party",
        "I really don't understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn't the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?",
        "Go away.",
        "We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem.",
        "Please go away.",
        "Said Pharaoh to Moses.",
        "Why are all these young women here?",
        "It's take your daughter to work day.",
        "Really, I was not aware of that.",
        "Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16.",
        "Hm?",
        "Smooth.",
        "Thank you.",
        "There's the man of the hour.",
        "Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women.",
        "(The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)",
        "Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?",
        "We need a social catalyst.",
        "Like what? We can't get fifteen-year-old girls drunk.",
        "Or can we?",
        "No, we can't.",
        "I don't think you mean we can't. I think you mean we shouldn't.",
        "Hey, Howard. You're a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it's definitely me.",
        "Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis.",
        "Okay. How about that one.",
        "Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won't even look at anybody in the gifted program. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you're in the back seat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.",
        "Are you crying?",
        "No, I have allergies.",
        "Okay, uh, how about her?",
        "Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you.",
        "Okay, so not her either. How about her?",
        "Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem.",
        "I think that's our girl. One of us should go talk to her.",
        "I can't talk to her, you do it.",
        "I can't just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her.",
        "Oh no, she'll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this.",
        "You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we'd be done.",
        "Well, we\u2019re not in India.",
        "Alright, why don't we do it your way then? We'll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.",
        "Okay, that was uncalled for.",
        "You started it, dude.",
        "Could I have everyone's attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We\u2019re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.",
        "(Sarcastically)",
        "Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.",
        "Youngest till the cyborgs rise up!",
        "And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!",
        "What?",
        "Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.",
        "Um, no thanks. I'm going to the mall with Emma.",
        "Well, uh, well, uh....",
        "The kid got a girl.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "Did anyone see how he did it?",
        "(To Gablehouser)",
        "He's back.",
        "Yeah, mission accomplished.",
        "Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?",
        "I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.",
        "Well, why do we go home alone every night, we\u2019re still smart.",
        "Maybe we\u2019re too smart. So smart it's offputting.",
        "Yeah, let's go with that.",
        "The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.",
        "Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.",
        "I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \u201cyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\u201d",
        "(There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.)",
        "Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.",
        "(Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)",
        "Yeah, we really ruined his life.",
        "Screw him, he was weak."
