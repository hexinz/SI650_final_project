        "Excuse me, this is my apartment and she's my roommate's sister.",
        "So what, you've already got Penny.",
        "How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?",
        "So I can have Penny?",
        "Hell, no!",
        "Excuse me, can I interject something. I'm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni?",
        "Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?",
        "I guess. Don't worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.",
        "Thank you.",
        "That's okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about.",
        "I'm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas!",
        "Hey, look at me, I don't have a foreskin.",
        "Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?",
        "Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.",
        "That's fascinating, but I...",
        "I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.",
        "Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister.",
        "Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.",
        "That's great, but I....",
        "What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.",
        "Whatever. You have to do something about it.",
        "Why?",
        "Because she's your sister.",
        "I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we\u2019ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.",
        "Okay, uh.... oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.",
        "I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.",
        "Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.",
        "You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.",
        "I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman!",
        "I'm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp.",
        "Alright, that's enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I'm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister.",
        "Who are you to decide that?",
        "He's the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.",
        "You're out too, by the way.",
        "Say what?",
        "It's nothing personal, I'd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn't become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie.",
        "Now that Leonard's made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister.",
        "Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that?",
        "We all make mistakes, let's move on.",
        "Excuse me, but I think you're missing a big opportunity here.",
        "How so?",
        "Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte.",
        "In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.",
        "Is it \u2018cause I'm Jewish, \u2018cause I'd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.",
        "This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you're a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother.",
        "Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable.",
        "Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.",
        "Oops.",
        "Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone?",
        "Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.",
        "Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?",
        "Truthfully, I\u2019ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.",
        "What on earth are you talking about?",
        "Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.",
        "And what do you mean, mediocre stock?",
        "That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.",
        "Sheldon 2.0?",
        "Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.",
        "You have got to be kidding me!",
        "Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.",
        "Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I\u2019ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.",
        "I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.",
        "I have an alternate proposal.",
        "Go on.",
        "You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.",
        "Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants.",
        "Look, we have to settle this.",
        "I agree. Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's because we\u2019ve all been hitting on her at the same time.",
        "She's not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who's apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair.",
        "Oh, you poor, deluded bastard.",
        "Don't start with me dude.",
        "You want to go again? Let's go.",
        "Sit down.",
        "Okay.",
        "If we\u2019re going to fight over Missy, let's do it the right way. The honorable way.",
        "And he's down!",
        "Come on, come on, get up.",
        "Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.",
        "I weep for humanity.",
        "Hi Penny, how's it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?",
        "Uh, pretty much, why?",
        "Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please?",
        "Of course.",
        "Hi, Leonard, what's up?",
        "Well, since you're leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you'd like to go out to dinner with me?",
        "That's so sweet. But no thanks.",
        "Oh. You have other plans, or...?",
        "No.",
        "Oh. Alright uh... enjoy the rest of your evening.",
        "Thanks. See you.",
        "What do you want, Howard?",
        "I'm fine, thanks for asking. I\u2019ve come to call on Missy.",
        "Missy?",
        "Hi Howard.",
        "The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?",
        "Not really. No.",
        "No.",
        "Missy?",
        "Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you'd show up.",
        "We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down.",
        "Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?",
        "Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.",
        "Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.",
        "Really?",
        "Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.",
        "You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?",
        "Well yeah.",
        "I'm a theoretical physicist.",
        "What's the difference?",
        "What's the difference?",
        "Goodbye Shelly.",
        "My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating."
