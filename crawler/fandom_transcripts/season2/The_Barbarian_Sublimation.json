        "Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?",
        "Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.",
        "Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.",
        "Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.",
        "Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.",
        "Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.",
        "(Pulling cheeto out of hair)",
        "Wow.",
        "Same \u2013 later. Penny is attacking a multi-headed monster with a sword on the screen.A muscular warrior in a cape walks onto the screen.",
        "Hey Penny, it's me again, Leonard.",
        "Leonard, I said not now.",
        "Yeah, I know, I'm just a little concerned about you.",
        "(Chops off his head.)",
        "Okay, maybe later.",
        "The university lunch room.",
        "Hey guys.",
        "Hey.",
        "(Indicating Sheldon)",
        "Penny's been keeping him up at night.",
        "Me too. But probably in a different way.",
        "She's gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she's playing non-stop.",
        "Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There's nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.",
        "Sheldon, wake up.",
        "Danger, danger.",
        "(Arriving)",
        "Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males.... oh, I'm too tired to do this.",
        "Right, I heard you've been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.",
        "She comes into my room. No-one's supposed to be in my room.",
        "Well, I would postulate that she's escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.",
        "I do that too. But probably in a different way.",
        "That's not what she's doing, Leslie, she's just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.",
        "Everything has to do with sex.",
        "(Puts up hand for a hand slap.)",
        "I'm not touching that.",
        "Leslie, you are way off base here.",
        "Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.",
        "Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.",
        "Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.",
        "I'll take the bullet.",
        "Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.",
        "(Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.)",
        "No.",
        "Would you like to be?",
        "Uh, sure, why not?",
        "Sheldon...",
        "Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?",
        "(checks out Sheldon\u2019s package)",
        "There, problem solved.",
        "Dumbass.",
        "Penny's flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.",
        "Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.",
        "Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.",
        "Got it.",
        "I must say, you're playing very well for a woman of 23?",
        "22.",
        "(Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)",
        "Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?",
        "What happened to the rest of your group?",
        "I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.",
        "Frenzy stance.",
        "Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!",
        "So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?",
        "What?",
        "These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.",
        "Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!",
        "Drink a healing potion.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?",
        "That's on the registration?",
        "Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.",
        "Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.",
        "Good to know. Big old five.",
        "The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man sitting on the sofa.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "Leonard, this is Tom.",
        "Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?",
        "Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.",
        "Chosen by science?",
        "Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.",
        "You got Penny to sign up for online dating?",
        "No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.",
        "This is bad.",
        "Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.",
        "Really, really bad.",
        "I'm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she's a big old five.",
        "(Entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed)",
        "Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.",
        "Hi Penny.",
        "Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we\u2019ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.",
        "Can we talk about this later.",
        "No, no, no, no, I need you now.",
        "But wouldn't you prefer to socialize with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.",
        "Whatever, I'll figure it out myself.",
        "Bye, Penny. I'm sorry, dude, she didn't look anything like her picture.",
        "They never do.",
        "Inside the game. Penny-warrior is standing next to a battle horse.",
        "Hello, fair Penny.",
        "Who are you?",
        "It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?",
        "Yeah, sure, why not?",
        "(Closes laptop and throws it away.)"
