        "Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.",
        "I don't drink coffee.",
        "They have other things.",
        "What do they have?",
        "I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries...",
        "Pastries such as bearclaws?",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "I don't like bearclaws.",
        "(Entering)",
        "Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?",
        "Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.",
        "Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.",
        "Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.",
        "Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I'm just enabling you.",
        "The apartment.",
        "This is pretty good Orange Chicken.",
        "Yeah, it's from Changs.",
        "Not Chows?",
        "No, Changs.",
        "What happened to Chows?",
        "It changed.",
        "(Leonard splutters and coughs)",
        "A little.",
        "I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.",
        "I sure hope so.",
        "Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?",
        "(Entering)",
        "Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there's the lactose intolerance.",
        "(Preparing an extension cord)",
        "(Sheldon knocks and enters again.)",
        "I have to make pee-pee.",
        "Time shift to later.",
        "Listen, I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.",
        "If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.",
        "Well, I think tonight was a very good start.",
        "Me too. You're sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?",
        "No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.",
        "Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.",
        "Sure.",
        "Again, it's your decision, you're the man.",
        "(Voice off, ascending the stairs)",
        "(Appearing round corner with Penny)",
        "No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.",
        "Hello.",
        "Leslie.",
        "Hi.",
        "(Penny turns and crosses hall.)",
        "(Leans in to kiss Leslie.)",
        "(Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.)",
        "(Whispering)",
        "(goes back inside flat. Closes door.)",
        "(Breaking off kiss)",
        "What?",
        "(closes door.)",
        "The university lunch room.",
        "I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.",
        "Come on, Sheldon, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.",
        "I don't care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.",
        "Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.",
        "You mean like Spock?",
        "Sure.",
        "Fascinating.",
        "(Arriving)",
        "Hey, why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us.",
        "(Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)",
        "If you're having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.",
        "Don't make this hard for me.",
        "It's not hard. It's simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.",
        "(Sits with Leslie.)",
        "The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.",
        "Hey, Sheldon.",
        "Penny.",
        "(Sheldon indicates extension cord.)",
        "Alright, let's say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone's not touching my food?",
        "Goodnight Sheldon.",
        "Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?",
        "Excuse me?",
        "I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?",
        "Okay, where is this coming from?",
        "Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.",
        "Your arch enemy?",
        "Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.",
        "Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.",
        "Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.",
        "Sheldon, come back, you're losing me.",
        "Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.",
        "Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.",
        "She called me dumbass.",
        "I know. I heard.",
        "Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill-considered relationship with Leonard.",
        "Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.",
        "No, that response is unacceptable to me.",
        "Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know...",
        "Smart? I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.",
        "Are you going to let me talk?",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.",
        "You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.",
        "Okay, let me put it this way, if you're really Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.",
        "Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?",
        "Because love trumps hate.",
        "Oh now you're just making stuff up.",
        "Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.",
        "Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.",
        "The apartment. Leonard and Leslie are kissing.",
        "(Entering)",
        "If the word is pee-pee, just do it.",
        "Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.",
        "Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.",
        "I'm listening, amuse me.",
        "Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors.",
        "Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.",
        "Are you going to let him talk to me like that?",
        "Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.",
        "(Sheldon grunts.)",
        "Sheldon, don't make that noise, it's disrespectful.",
        "I hope so, it was a snort of derision.",
        "You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.",
        "Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.",
        "Well, I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.",
        "Truth, what truth? We\u2019re talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it's no big deal.",
        "Oh, it isn't, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?",
        "I guess we let them wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.",
        "(Storms off.)",
        "Wait, where are you going?",
        "(Leaves.)",
        "Look on the bright side.",
        "What's the bright side?",
        "Only nine more months to comic-con.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "The Renaissance Fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon is Spock and has a tri-corder.",
        "Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.",
        "Yeah, that's great, you guys want corn dogs?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn't come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century."
