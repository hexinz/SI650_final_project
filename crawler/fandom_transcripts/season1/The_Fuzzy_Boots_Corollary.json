        "You might be bound by them right now.",
        "That's true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?",
        "Of course not.",
        "Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?",
        "Well, no.",
        "I smell robot.",
        "(Entering)",
        "The internet's been down for half an hour.",
        "Also, Sheldon may be a robot.",
        "So, how did it go with Leslie?",
        "Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.",
        "You could power down.",
        "Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.",
        "A salsa class. The four guys and a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women.",
        "Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven.",
        "(To Leonard)",
        "The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing song.",
        "Oh, good lord.",
        "(Singing)",
        "(Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag",
        "I know what you're thinking, I\u2019ve taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.",
        "Leonard, listen to me...",
        "I\u2019ve been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.",
        "Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?",
        "Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.",
        "Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.",
        "It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me.",
        "Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flash light searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.",
        "You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.",
        "No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat.",
        "No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.",
        "Oh, goody, we\u2019re getting a cat.",
        "The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny\u2019s door.",
        "(Opening door)",
        "Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh... I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.",
        "Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?",
        "There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.",
        "Supper?",
        "Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.",
        "Uh, six thirty's great.",
        "Really? Great!",
        "Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.",
        "Us guys?",
        "You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all's coming?",
        "They.... might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quiznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn't, it's no fault of Quiznos, they have a varied menu.",
        "Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.",
        "Great. Did we say a time?",
        "Six thirty.",
        "And that's still good for you.",
        "It's fine.",
        "Cos it's not carved in stone.",
        "No, six thirty's great.",
        "I'll get my chisel.",
        "Why?",
        "To... carve the... okay, I'll see you six thirty.",
        "Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment. Leonard enters from bedrooms, dressed in a smart shirt and trousers. They are covered in sweat stains.",
        "How do I look?",
        "Could you be more specific?",
        "Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?",
        "No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?",
        "Six thirty.",
        "Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate.",
        "Is it too much?",
        "Not if you're a rugby team.",
        "By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn't join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quiznos.",
        "Why would I join you?",
        "No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn't such a good idea.",
        "Oh, no, no, no, well now, there's always the possibility that alcohol and poor\u00a0judgement\u00a0on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.",
        "You're right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.",
        "Of course, there's the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.",
        "You could have stopped at \u201cit could go well.\u201d",
        "If I could of, I would of.",
        "I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy. There's no reason we couldn't go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, \u201cyou love pottery? I love pottery!\u201d You know, there's a pause, we both know what's happening, I lean in, we kiss, it's a little tentative at first but then I realize, she's kissing me back, and she's biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we\u2019re going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!",
        "Is the sex starting now?",
        "I'm having a panic attack.",
        "Oh, okay, well then, calm down.",
        "If I could calm down I wouldn't be having a panic attack, that's why they call it a panic attack.",
        "Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.",
        "Why?",
        "Just do it.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.",
        "What?",
        "It's a bio-feedback technique, it's relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.",
        "Oh, who am I kidding, I can't go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.",
        "Me?",
        "Yes.",
        "What should I tell her.",
        "I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.",
        "Okay.",
        "Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she'll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.",
        "Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal. I'll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven't quite bounced back.",
        "Give me the phone.",
        "But I thought you wanted to cancel?",
        "I can't because if I don't show up she'll still be expecting you.",
        "Why would she be expecting me?",
        "Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.",
        "A restaurant.",
        "So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?",
        "Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.",
        "Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.",
        "You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.",
        "How?",
        "We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.",
        "So, what's new in the world of physics?",
        "Nothing.",
        "Really, nothing?",
        "Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say \u201chey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.\u201d",
        "Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.",
        "What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?",
        "Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.",
        "Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.",
        "Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...",
        "Can I get you started with some drinks?",
        "(waves her away)",
        "I'd like a drink.",
        "Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.",
        "Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.",
        "Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.",
        "It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless hours of... well, you know.",
        "I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer.",
        "No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.",
        "Well, chafing, right?",
        "Emotionally.",
        "(Penny nods.)",
        "How?",
        "(He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side)",
        "Wow, centrifugal force!",
        " (The olive drops.)",
        "Are you okay?",
        "Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?",
        "No.",
        "I'm not okay.",
        "The stairwell of the apartment building.",
        "Are you sure you don't want to go to the emergency room?",
        "No, no, I'm okay, it's stopped bleeding.",
        "I know, but you did throw up. Isn't that a sign of a concussion?",
        "Yes, but I get car sick too, so...",
        "Okay.",
        "Sorry about your car, by the way.",
        "Oh, no, it's fine, you got most of it out the window.",
        "The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.",
        "(Leonard turns across hallway.)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Was this supposed to be a date?",
        "This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn't show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.",
        "Okay, I was just checking.",
        "When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she's been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I'm going to go lay down for a while, good night.",
        "The apartment, Leonard enters.",
        "So, how was your date?",
        "Awesome!",
        "Score one for liquor and poor judgement."
