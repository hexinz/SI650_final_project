        "(Raj whispers in his ear)",
        "Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise.",
        "Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.",
        "(Raj whispers in Leonard\u2019s ear.)",
        "Whatever you recommend.",
        "Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?",
        "I'll have a diet coke.",
        "Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.",
        "Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba libre.",
        "That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.",
        "Yes,",
        "So coke.",
        "Yes. And would you make it diet?",
        "There's a can in the fridge.",
        "A Cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.",
        "Then swim to Cuba.",
        "Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.",
        "Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who's next?",
        "I'd like to try a slippery nipple.",
        "Okay, you're cut off. Anybody need a refill?",
        "Where did my life go, Penny? One day I'm a carefree bachelor, and the next I'm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi.",
        "A... are you talking to me?",
        "Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course.",
        "It's amazing.",
        "Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it's time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam.",
        "Okay, sweetie, I think that's the grasshopper talking.",
        "And it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta.",
        "Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don't you just meet this girl and, see what happens.",
        "Haven't you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.",
        "Um... Raj.",
        "No, no, let's see how long it takes him.",
        "Um, Raj, honey, you say you can't talk to women but... you've been talking to me.",
        "And now we'll never know.",
        "You're right. I... I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?",
        "I'm fine.",
        "Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It's a sweet green miracle.",
        "Okay, if you're going to drink on this date just promise me you won't overdo it.",
        "Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?",
        "Yeah, that. Uh, why don't you bring her to my restaurant when I'm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?",
        "Okay.",
        "Wait a minute, what's the plan here? Let's say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what's he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?",
        "Worked for my parents.",
        "The restaurant.",
        "I can't believe I'm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta.",
        "Well, you are.",
        "Little Lalita. That's kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.",
        "No, it's okay.",
        "You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat?",
        "Well, I\u2019ve been trying.",
        "So you're a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you're still winning.",
        "Yay me!",
        "(To Penny)",
        "Drinks do not work that way.",
        "I'd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail.",
        "Sorry I'm late.",
        "What happened?",
        "Nothing, I just really didn't want to come. Virgin diet Cuba libre please.",
        "Okay.",
        "In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.",
        "Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.",
        "So, how's Koothrappali d.... oh my Lord.",
        "What?",
        "That's Princess Punchali.",
        "I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.",
        "No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess.",
        "Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card.",
        "It's a children's story.",
        "Oh, no it isn't.",
        "When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It's about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly.",
        "I know the reason.",
        "We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?",
        "That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?",
        "Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but...",
        "Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn't it great, she isn't fat any more!",
        "Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali.",
        "Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?",
        "A beloved character from an Indian folk tale.",
        "Oh. Us Indian, or \u201ccome to our casino\u201d Indian?",
        "You Indian.",
        "Oh.",
        "The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair.",
        "Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too.",
        "I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can.",
        "Really, so do I.",
        "But you're a dentist, he's nuts.",
        "Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.",
        "It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.",
        "Oh my.",
        "Back off Sheldon.",
        "What?",
        "If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.",
        "I'm not hitting on her.",
        "And I am not your lady.",
        "And you have no wrath.",
        "You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.",
        "Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.",
        "Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.",
        "Oh, screw Princess Punchali.",
        "Hey, you can't talk to me like that.",
        "But you're not Princess Punchali.",
        "Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.",
        "Sheldon, are you hungry?",
        "I could eat.",
        "Let's go.",
        "What just happened?",
        "Beats the hell out of me.",
        "I'll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks.",
        "Apartment 4A. Raj is talking to his parents on the webcam.",
        "What are we supposed to say to Lalita's parents?",
        "I play golf with her father, I won't be able to look at him.",
        "Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa.",
        "Oh, now you're a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man.",
        "Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.",
        "This is a family matter Sheldon.",
        "No, I'm Leonard.",
        "Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us.",
        "(Sheldon enters)",
        "Who is it? We can't see.",
        "Turn us, turn us.",
        "Go ahead, tell my parents why they won't have any grandchildren.",
        "How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?",
        "This has nothing to do with my sperm count.",
        "You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren't you Rajesh.",
        "Yes Mommy.",
        "Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.",
        "Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",
        "What did I do?",
        "You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.",
        "Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",
        "Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?",
        "Take it, Raj. It's more than I\u2019ve ever gotten.",
        "And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.",
        "Drunk?",
        "And boring, her words.",
        "I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic.",
        "I'm not an alcoholic.",
        "Then why were you drunk?",
        "It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.",
        "Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention?",
        "Don't embarrass him in front of his friends.",
        "Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private.",
        "But Papa, please....",
        "Now, Rajesh.",
        "(to Leonard and Sheldon)",
        "Now listen to me....",
        "Please wait until I get into the hall.",
        "Okay, well, good night.",
        "Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?",
        "We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn't already know, and I came home.",
        "So you're not going to see her again?",
        "(Exits)",
        "I wonder who's going to tell his parents they're not having grandchildren.",
        "Penny\u2019s restaurant. Sheldon is on the piano, singing \u201cTo Life\u201d from Fiddler on the Roof enthusiastically.",
        "I don't believe it, what's gotten into him?",
        "Oh, maybe a couple of virgin Cuba libres that turned out to be kind of ... slutty.",
        "You didn't?",
        "Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine."
