        "Okay.",
        "maybe we should take a little break.",
        "Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.",
        "(After Raj whispers in his ear)",
        "What did he say?",
        "He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer's eve.",
        "Yeah, and the bag it came in.",
        "The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",
        "Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.",
        "Can it wait, I need to talk to you.",
        "Just look. I\u2019ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colors are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold.",
        "Why do they say AA?",
        "Army Ants.",
        "Isn't that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people.",
        "Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminum?",
        "No, I meant.... never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!",
        "Oh neat, what's the occasion?",
        "Well, you're a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you're off the team.",
        "What?",
        "Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting.",
        "No you didn't.",
        "Yes we did, I just came from it.",
        "Okay, I don't know where you just came from, but it couldn't have been a team meeting because I'm on the team and I wasn't there, ergo the team did not meet.",
        "Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you're off the team.",
        "Why?",
        "Because you're taking all the fun out of it.",
        "Well, I'm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?",
        "Okay, let me try it this way, you're annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more.",
        "I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.",
        "Thanks for the heads up.",
        "You're welcome. One more thing.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's on, bitch.",
        "The cafeteria.",
        "So who'd he get to be on his team.",
        "He won't say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar.",
        "He's using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you.",
        "How exactly would that laugh go?",
        "Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!",
        "That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians.",
        "Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.",
        "So?",
        "So nothing, let's destroy him.",
        "(Walking past)",
        "Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!",
        "Okay, we\u2019re going to need a strong fourth for our team.",
        "You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.",
        "Raj, we\u2019re not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.",
        "How about the girl from the Wonder Years?",
        "Gentlemen, I believe I\u2019ve found the solution to all our problems.",
        "We can't ask Leslie Winkle.",
        "Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?",
        "Yes.",
        "Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.",
        "Yeah. Sack up, dude.",
        "Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.",
        "Hi guys.",
        "Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I...",
        "Hit that thang.",
        "Leonard, there's no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we\u2019ve seen each other's faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus.",
        "There's not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be.",
        "Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.",
        "That's all very comforting, but if it's okay, I'd like to get on with my question now.",
        "Proceed.",
        "We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.",
        "No thanks, I'm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.",
        "Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano.",
        "Wait, you're going up against Sheldon Cooper?",
        "Yes.",
        "That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing?",
        "She's in.",
        "The Physics Bowl.",
        "(The guys look confused.)",
        "Oh, yeah. You know you don't have to stay for the whole thing.",
        "Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting.",
        "(Entering in his Star Trek themed shirt)",
        "Sheldon.",
        "Sheldon.",
        "Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.",
        "Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.",
        "So, is that your team.",
        "Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?",
        "Hello, Sheldon.",
        "Leslie Winkle?",
        "Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?",
        "Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.",
        "Oh, ouch.",
        "Okay, if everyone could please take your seats.",
        "(Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.)",
        "PMS? It's a couple of days early, but...",
        "No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.",
        "Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking?",
        "Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year's physics bowl. Today's preliminary match features two great teams... AA versus PMS.",
        "(Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads \u201cWe Can Go All Night\u201d.)",
        "(Buzz)",
        "The Eta Meson.",
        "Correct.",
        "Formal protest.",
        "On what grounds?",
        "The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.",
        "(Buzz)",
        "And of course, the answer is Technetium.",
        "(Buzz)",
        "Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.",
        "Correct.",
        "(Time shift)",
        "(Buzz)",
        "Shor's Algorithm.",
        "Correct.",
        "(Time shift)",
        "4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.",
        "(Time shift)",
        "Prevost's theory of exchanges.",

        "(Time shift)",
        "A sigma particle.",
        "(Time shift)",
        "Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.",
        "Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation.",
        "Holy crap.",
        "What the hell is that.",
        "It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell.",
        "Come on, think, Leslie.",
        "Leonard, it's not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.",
        "You're never going to let that go, are you?",
        "(Buzz)",
        "Sorry, I panicked.",
        "Then guess.",
        "(Gablehouser stares at him.)",
        "I'm sorry, that's incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours.",
        "He doesn't have it. He's got squat.",
        "(Sheldon looks more and more uncomfortable, so much he is involuntarily twitching.)",
        "(Buzz)",
        "The answer is minus eight by alpha.",
        "Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?",
        "Answering question. Winning physics bowl.",
        "How do you know anything about physics?",
        "Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Polytechnica. Go Polar Bears.",
        "Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.",
        "You didn't answer question.",
        "(Makes fist in the air)",
        "AA, I need your official answer.",
        "Well it's not what he said.",
        "Then what is it?",
        "I want a different question.",
        "You can't have a different question.",
        "Formal protest.",
        "Denied.",
        "Informal protest.",
        "Denied. I need your official answer.",
        "No. I decline to provide one.",
        "Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.",
        "That's your opinion.",
        "Alright, the winner of the match is...",
        "Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.",
        "I don't understand the question.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "The winner is PMS!",
        "(We Are The Champions by Queen plays as the team celebrate in slow motion and Sheldon puts his head in his hands. The celebration ends with Howard on his knees ripping his shirt in half and waving it round his head before throwing it to the audience.)",
        "Apartment 4A. Sheldon goes to sit in his spot.",
        "Sorry, somebody's sitting there.",
        "Who?",
        "My Physics Bowl Trophy!",
        "That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win.",
        "I know someone who would disagree.",
        "Who?",
        "(In weird voice)",
        "Alright that is very immature.",
        "(In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon\u2019s face)",
        "(Entering)",
        "What are you doing?",
        "I'm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Bring it on.",
        "(They stare at her.)",
        "(After they look at each other in confusion)",
        "(Pause)",
        "How do you know these things?",
        "I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine's sexiest man alive?",
        "William Shatner.",
        "Wait, I don't think it's Shatner.",
        "Then it's got to be Patrick Stewart.",
