        "You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?",
        "(Internally)",
        "It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.",
        "I mean, just because most of the men I\u2019ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?",
        "(Internally)",
        "(She hugs him.)",
        "(Internally)",
        "Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game.",
        "(Jumping off game mat)",
        "It's fine. You win.",
        "What's his problem?",
        "His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.",
        "Been there.",
        "(Entering)",
        "Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?",
        "Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.",
        "What did she say? Is she still mad at me?",
        "Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and... then she hugged me.",
        "(Raj hugs Howard.)",
        "Intoxicating, isn't it?",
        "The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny\u2019s door. It opens.",
        "Hi.",
        "Oh.",
        "What's going on?",
        "(Reads from note.)",
        "Leonard.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(Hugs him)",
        "Penny\u2019s apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.",
        "Six two inch dowels.",
        "Check.",
        "One package, Phillips head screws.",
        "Check.",
        "You guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre.",
        "No, please, we insist, it\u2019s the least we can do considering.",
        "Considering what? How great this place looks?",
        "(Across room with Raj)",
        "What?",
        "These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.",
        "Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.",
        "It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.",
        "We could put her stereo back there.",
        "And control it how?",
        "Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.",
        "(After Raj whispers in his ear)",
        "Hey guys, I got this.",
        "Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?",
        "Also inefficient, and might be loud.",
        "How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...",
        "Guys, this is actually really simple.",
        "Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.",
        "Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?",
        "And if water is involved we\u2019re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.",
        "Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.",
        "Oh, I\u2019ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminum.",
        "Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.",
        "Perfect, Leonard, why don't you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square meters of scrap aluminum, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.",
        "Meet back here in an hour?",
        "Done.",
        "(They all leave).",
        "Okay, this place does look pretty good."
