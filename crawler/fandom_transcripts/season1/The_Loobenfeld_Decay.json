        "What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.",
        "Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.",

        "Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?",

        "Oh...!",
        "Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.",
        "No. We\u2019re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.",

        "The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.",
        "Don't forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.",
        "That's never been proven.",
        "There have been studies.",

        "Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You're gonna do okay.",
        "One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time.",
        "How long is he going to stay here.",
        "He's a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
