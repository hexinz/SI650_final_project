        "Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.",
        "Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner.",
        "Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn't buy for themselves.",
        "You mean, like a sweater?",
        "Well, it's a fun sweater, it's got a bold geometric print.",
        "Is it the geometry that makes it fun.",
        "Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them.",
        "Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Something he wouldn't buy for himself. Something fun. Something like... oh, an 802.11n wireless router.",
        "Apartment 4A",
        "(Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying \u201coh, that did not feel good.\u201d)",
        "(Picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.)",
        "What's the matter?",
        "This granola bar, there's peanuts in it.",
        "Oh my God, why did you eat it?",
        "I don't know, it was just there.",
        "Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself?",
        "Don't yell at me, I\u2019ve got to go to the emergency room.",
        "Now?",
        "No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket.",
        "Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.",
        "(into phone after Leonard leaves room)",
        "(Running in)",
        "The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.",
        "What do you think.",
        "(Pointing randomly)",
        "Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.",
        "Sure.",
        "He doesn't need them, he's already got a 640 connect switch",
        "Oh, okay then this one.",
        "Why?",
        "I don't know, the man on the box looks so happy.",
        "Penny! If I'm going to buy Leonard a gift, I'm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did.",
        "Oh, I know I'm going to regret this but, what trauma?",
        "On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes.",
        "Of course.",
        "Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me... wow, this is hard. They got me... a motorised dirt bike.",
        "No?",
        "What twelve-year-old boy wants a motorised dirt bike?",
        "All of them.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Huh?",
        "Okay, so we\u2019re getting this one?",
        "Yeah, I suppose.",
        "Okay, let's go.",
        "Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff?",
        "I know everything about this stuff.",
        "Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse.",
        "Here, buy this one. Look, it's the one we\u2019re getting, see, happy guy available.",
        "No, no, no, no, she doesn't want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?",
        "It depends on what Bus you have.",
        "I drive a Chevy Cavalier.",
        "Oh, dear lord.",
        "Sheldon, we have to go.",
        "(To woman approaching)",
        "The hospital. Howard runs in and up to the counter.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "Fill this out, have a seat.",
        "No, listen, see we\u2019re throwing my friend a surprise party and I'm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.",
        "Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat.",
        "No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I'm allergic to peanuts.",
        "Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat.",
        "Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half.",
        "Is that all you need?",
        "Yes.",
        "Get out of my ER.",
        "No, you don't understand.",
        "Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid.",
        "(holding up a five dollar bill)",
        "Unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time.",
        "(Running in)",
        "Bad, very bad.",
        "Really, \u2018cos you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home.",
        "We can\u2019t go home.",
        "Why not?",
        "(pretends tongue has swollen up)",
        "Alright, I\u2019ll be right back.",
        "(Into phone)",
        "(With Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers)",
        "I don\u2019t think I can.",
        "You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell \u201csurprise!\u201d",
        "Okay, you have to understand something, we\u2019re in a hospital right now.",
        "Why, is Leonard okay.",
        "Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.",
        "Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.",
        "Look, I\u2019ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.",
        "Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.",
        "Don't toy with me, woman.",
        "I\u2019ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I\u2019ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.",
        "(Thinks. Reaches into back pocket, finds the half a granola bar from earlier. Looks down.)",
        "The store. Sheldon is on the in-store computer.",
        "Okay, we don't have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.",
        "(With shop assistant, points at Sheldon)",
        "Excuse me, sir, you don't work here.",
        "Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else.",
        "Sheldon, we have to go.",
        "Why?",
        "Well, for one thing, we\u2019re late for Leonard's birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security.",
        "(To customer)",
        "Keep walking.",
        "Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password.",
        "The hospital.",
        "Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.",
        "No he's not.",
        "Yes he is.",
        "(sees Howard whose face has swollen all over)",
        "Pees hep me!",
        "Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.",
        "Fank-u.",
        "The stairwell.",
        "Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they're afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything.",
        "I really don't think the colonoscopy was necessary.",
        "You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party.",
        "Oh, right, it's your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it's all over now.",
        "There is a party, isn't there.",
        "Maybe.",
        "Howard.",
        "Are you mad?",
        "how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.",
        "Yeah, that's why I did it.",
        "Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.",
        "(Opens door. Raj is drunkenly singing True Colors very badly into a microphone with his shirt off and a bandana round his head while waving a beer bottle. Penny and Sheldon are asleep on the couch and armchair respectively.)",
        "Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!",
        "Time shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.",
        "(girl pours booze into his mouth)",
        "That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I\u2019ve got to introduce her to Howard.",
        "Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.",
        "I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.",
        "Oh, it's okay.",
        "(She kisses him full on the lips.)",
        "Hey Penny, when, uh, when's your birthday?"
