go to the North Pole,(2 23) Leonard: Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?,2,
go to the North Pole,"(3 9) Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.",1,
go to the North Pole,"(4 17) Penny: Oh, it’s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.",1,
go to the North Pole,(2 23) Sheldon: No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.,2,

go to the North Pole,"(6 24) Howard: I’m proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that’s really something.",0,
go to the North Pole,"(3 6) Howard: Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.",0,
go to the North Pole,"(2 2) Leonard: Well, there’s Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it’s a little geographically undesireable.",0,
go to the North Pole,"(7 1) Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing): Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?",0,
