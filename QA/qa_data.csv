Howard: There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support. Sheldon: Indeed. I was the world’s smartest caterpillar.

The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin. Raj: Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who? Bert: Right. I wasn’t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate. Sheldon: A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend. Leonard: Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick? Bernadette: Hold on, who decides who’s worthy? Does the hammer decide? Penny: Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so… who are you calling? Amy: Who’s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he’s sick?

Leonard: Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan. Priya: Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news. Leonard: Given her what? Sheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now? Bert: You know, as a MacArthur Grant winner, I’m allowed to nominate someone for next year.

And even if Hawking’s theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I’m interested in the big questions. Sheldon: That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either. Scene: The apartment. Banging on door. Stuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs. Bernadette: Oh, sure you did. Who’s Mama’s big space man? Lucy: Well, let’s see. I’d love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don’t like bangs. Howard: As in, costumes? Leonard: Hey, look who’s out after dark, like a big boy.",Sheldon
Who had a Dumbledore costume,"Sheldon: That’s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume. Sheldon: I’m gonna go as Dumbledore. Sheldon: Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary? Sheldon: That’s a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn’t see it coming, either. Howard: As in, costumes? Costume guy: How’s that feel? Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.) Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change. Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks. Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi! Leonard: Because it’s not a costume, it’s a flight suit. Howard: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where’s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut? Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start? Sheldon: I’m confused. If there’s no costume parade, what are we doing here? Stuart: Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane? Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. : Oh, hey guys. Zack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?",Sheldon
Who wanted to go on the Small World ride at Disneyland,"Leonard: Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland? Bernadette: Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland? Penny: We’re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn? Leonard: Small world. Penny: We’re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn? Penny: And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It’s a Small World. Howard: A world I don’t want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world. Amy: In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War? Stuart: Not really. She’s horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane? Howard: There she is. Who’s ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert? Penny: Okay, fine, it’s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want? Leonard: You’re taking him to Disneyland? Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come. Howard: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was. Sheldon: Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, I’d steal it. Howard: There’s two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support. : Disneyland. Go on, I’m listening. Penny: Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World? Penny: Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar? Penny: I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don’t want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.",Leonard

Beverley: Well, I would assume it’s because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues. Sheldon: In my defence, I prefaced that by saying “with all due respect.” Sheldon: No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.

Who did a social experiment,"Howard: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment. Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious! Leonard: It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. Leonard: Hey, you know who’d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny. Sheldon: Neither do I, but it’s the social convention. Howard: Social anxiety. Raj: I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people. Sheldon: It’s an experiment. Raj: We need a social catalyst. Howard: Since when do you read social science? Sheldon: So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium? Sheldon: Amy, this isn’t easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you’re in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo. Sheldon: I’m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid. Sheldon: Perform the experiment immediately. Sheldon: You tampered with my experiment? Leonard: It does. But in my experience, you don’t. Bernadette: So, how’s your experiment going? Penny: Really? We’re going to do an experiment? Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste. Sheldon: And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that’s not my style.",Howard
Who thought the scavenger hunt is a interesting social experiment,"Raj: Okay, everybody. Who’s ready for a scavenger hunt? Howard: Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment. Penny: I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time. Sheldon: Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt. Raj: Just hear me out. I’m going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T. Raj: Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt. Raj: Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon’s contact information. Raj: What the? Are you crazy? You can’t talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious! Amy: Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story’s more sad than funny. Howard: You’re weighing me down. I’m a falcon who hunts better solo. Leonard: I thought you weren’t interested in me. Leonard: Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought… Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn’t that interesting? Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger’s cat is a thought experiment… Leonard: I’m the one who thought of it. Leonard: It’s the social protocol, it’s what you do when you have a friend who’s proud of something they really suck at. Sheldon: She’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them. That’s when Amy said, want to make this interesting? Sheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let’s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment. Penny: Okay, I know you don’t have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you. Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I’d come home and surprise you.",Howard
Who did the taxes when Howard played video games,"Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes. Penny: You’re sitting here playing video games all day. Scene: Sheldon and Leonard’s living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game. Howard: Kids are always better at video games. Leonard: Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys? Howard: Role-playing games? Howard: Have you ever played a game with Bernadette? Bernadette: Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares? Policeman: Assorted video games. Howard: I invented a game. You want to play? Ramona: Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn’t waste an evening playing video games. Howard: How are the taxes going? Leonard: Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad. Leonard: It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work… (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.) Howard: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing? Leonard: Come on, it’s just a video game. And we suck at it.

Who is going to jail for tax fraud,"Bernadette: Howard, you’re going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares? Howard: How are the taxes going? Howard: Okay, he’s going to jail. Leonard: If I’m going to jail, I’m killing him, not breaking his thumb. Sheldon: All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I’m not going to jail for you. Sheldon: Before taxes. Raj: We’re both frauds. I’m sorry, I’m a fraud, he’s a fraud. Stuart: Was just doing my taxes. Sheldon: That’s true. There’s the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail. Sheldon: No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers. Penny: Sheldon’s in jail. Leonard: Sheldon’s in jail? Susan: All right, that’s enough jail talk. Susan: What you’ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail? Penny: Well, I don’t have to pay taxes on this stuff. Judge: Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I’m going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark. Leonard: Really? This is going to decide who’s the hero and who’s the sidekick? Amy: Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding? Penny: Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn’t occur to me. If he doesn’t apologize by 5 o’clock he is going to spend the night in jail.",Howard

Howard: Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes. Raj: Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud. Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I’m worse than a fraud. I’m practically a biologist. Leonard: Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds? Sheldon: Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert. Sheldon: No. We are committing genetic fraud. There’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers. Sheldon: I don’t see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property. Sheldon: The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous. Howard: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It’s like a secret tax on guys who can’t get laid. Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I’m not a genius, I’m a fraud. Sheldon: You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. It’s too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. They’re erasing our lives. Sheldon: My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.",Howard
Who had plans to live on Mars,"Sheldon: Or if they accept Daddy’s application to live on Mars. Amy: You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something. Leonard: For some reason, we’re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever. Sheldon: Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about? Raj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. Sheldon: My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It’s called living off the land. Alex: Oh, I know, I’m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend? Amy: Are you asking me to go to Mars with you? Page: The Mars Rover? Leonard: Yeah, I’m sorry, too. We’re about to share the rest of our lives together. It’s our money, who cares who has it? : Who lives in a pineapple. Nope. Howard: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It’s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house. Penny: Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don’t love having you, but it’s… a little crowded. Voice from TV: The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It’s unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing’s certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It’s a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we’ll never know who’s responsible. Amy: You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon. Girl: He said that I could drive a car on Mars. Sheldon: Did I say Mars Rover? Leonard: I’ll bet he’s some loser who lives with his parents.

Raj: It’s pretty cool, they’ve got me in with a guy who’s doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who’s using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno. Leonard: He’s not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing? Bernadette: Maybe he uses Kryptonite.",Leonard
Who had old string theory books,"Sheldon: Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books? Sheldon: Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. Sheldon: How dare the university force me to go back to string theory? Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory. Sheldon: Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman’s terms, string theory. Leonard: Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930’s, and you can’t prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.” Sheldon: I’m writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory. Amy: I’m sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory. Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn’t you try to help me? Sheldon: Oh, I’m working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space. Leonard: You know, there’s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram. Leonard: I guess we let them wait until they’re old enough and let them choose their own theory. Sheldon: Thank you. I assume you’d like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory? Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I’m going to kill you! Leslie: Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory. Amy: Um, used to be string theory, now it’s dark matter. But let’s not discuss Sheldon. Let’s get back to you. Sheldon: Awful. They’re allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class. : I’ve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates! Sheldon: That’s actually not bad advice. You know, I didn’t seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day. Leonard: You mean for someone who’s into comic books?",Sheldon
Who had food poisoning,"Sheldon: You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television. Bernadette: Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay. Howard: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking. Sheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke. Sheldon: This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food. Sheldon: If we were, the food would be better. Raj: It has more food too. Amy: Get your food. Leonard: So what? It’s the same food. Raj: Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn’t believe in to end his life quickly. Raj: You’d have no girlfriend to see you naked, you’d try to fill the void with food, and I’m an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake. Sheldon: Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket. Raj: I know they’re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops. Raj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned. Leonard: You’re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can’t both have Frodo, so guess who’s stuck with Samwise Gamgee. Sheldon: This is Thai food. Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us? : That’s it? There’s not enough food. Penny: How about Thai food? Penny: This food is amazing.",Howard
The gas station suchi caused who food poisoning,"Leonard: The, the gas station across the street. Sheldon: After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase? Howard: Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I’d really appreciate it if we could move on. Sheldon: You know, I’m not the only one who’s unpleasant when they’re sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television. Leonard: Come on, let’s just start walking. There’s got to be a gas station or something nearby. Raj: A successful quest. Now let’s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom. Bernadette: Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay. Leonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars. Howard: Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.  Sheldon: You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car. Penny: Oh, and there’s not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there. Leonard: Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I’m tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It’s a vicious circle. Leonard: So, gas. Penny: ‘Cause it’s stupid. Who cares what number it is? Howard: ‘Cause I’m an idiot who didn’t think this through. Howard: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don’t go there for the food, you go there for the view. Amy: I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ’cause people love monkeys. Leonard: No. Lactose. Gas. Penny: Do you know how much gas is?",Howard
Who left and vocie mail for Stephen Hawking,"Sheldon: I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking. Howard: Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking. Raj: Mmm, Greek food on pizza night?

Stephen Hawking. Howard: Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking? Stephen Hawking: Well, hello there. Sheldon: Stephen Hawking hates me. Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office. Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office. Scene: Stephen Hawking’s office. : Hello, Sheldon. Sheldon: Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad? Stephen Hawking: Do you like brain teasers? : Hello, Sheldon. Amy: Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking? Howard: It’s a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974. Stephen Hawking: Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces. Stephen Hawking: I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.",Sheldon

Voice Inside: Who is it? : I ate the cherry. All that’s left is green. : Who is it?! Howard: He drank from Leonard’s glass. Sheldon: Alcohol? I don’t drink alcohol. : Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210. Amy: Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us. Sheldon: I drank milk that tasted funny. : Who’s there? Are you a sex criminal? Sheldon: The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser. Sheldon: No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered. Bert: It’s hard to say. I don’t remember much after I drank it. Raj: I’m not an alcoholic. Penny: Do you have any alcohol? Leonard: You got alcohol? Sheldon: We’re all out of alcohol. Sheldon: Alcohol.",Sheldon

I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us. Sheldon: Unfortunately, we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab. Sheldon: Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you. Sheldon: And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now? Penny: The one from whom I live across the hall from. Sheldon: I was going to get my mail. Sheldon: Open the mail! , I’m using it. Priya: Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that’s good news. Sheldon: There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it. Sheldon: Be sure to check the mail. Sheldon: I left them in the bowl. Sheldon: Yet another child left behind.",Stephen Hawking
Who wanted something romantic to celebrate the first date,"Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you’ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date? Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you. Howard: No, I want this to be romantic. Sheldon: Then, this is my first date. Raj: I don’t want to celebrate. Raj: I am a man who can’t talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can’t be around other people. Leonard: So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with? Penny: You’re dating somebody, who is it? Leonard: Thank you. What did she mean, she’s happy for me? Is she happy because I’m seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I’m happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person. Sheldon: Your first date? Did you even measure her walls? Amy: Our-our first date was at a coffee shop. Penny: Well, you want a date, pick a date. Amy: I’m sorry. Who are you dating? Howard: The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called? Amy: Can you believe it’s been five years since our first date? Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either. Howard: Okay, who’s up first? Bernadette: Who’s Siri? Is he dating somebody new? Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette. Raj: It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?",Penny
